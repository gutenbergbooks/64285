<p class="title2"><b>Reminiscences Of A Private.</b></p>

<p>When our children come from other states and from
foreign lands to visit Jacksonport, the old home of their
parents, they find the pitiful remnant of a village. Streets
overgrown with weeds, dilapidated wooden cottages, a
tumbled down brick court house, meet their eyes. One or
two well-kept homes and a prosperous general store only
emphasize the prevailing air of decay. The visitors may
walk a mile down the road to the old town Elizabeth, and
find no trace of habitation. The persimmon, the paw paw
and the muscadine flourish in spaces that were once busy
streets. When they remember that this place lacked only
one vote of being made the capital of the state they may
ponder on the uncertainty of human destiny.</p>

<p>But in 1861 Jacksonport was an important town. It
was the county seat when Jackson county was much larger
than it is now. Woodruff was a part of it and the whole
formed a wealthy section of the state, the rich “bottoms”
producing the finest cotton. Jacksonport was situated
where Black River flows into White River, and was the
center of distribution for many counties. At low water,
which was the greater part of the year, it was at the head
of navigation and people came from fifty miles to trade
there, hauling overland all freight for Batesville and upper
points.</p>

<p>It was then one of the great river towns, and one of
the most fascinating occupations of my boyhood was
watching the steamboats. We had two mail steamers,
side-wheelers, up-to-date, with all kinds of accommodations
for passengers and freight, and I have seen nine
steamers loading and unloading at once. One packet from
Louisville, one from St. Louis, two from Memphis, two
from Upper Black River, and two from New Orleans. I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
have seen one of the last, “The Seminole,” with a load of
fifteen hundred bales of cotton.</p>

<p>At that time Jacksonport had a population of twenty-five
hundred. The surrounding farms and plantations,
cultivated by negro slaves, were owned by the Tunstalls,
Waddells, Robinsons, Gardners and others. Old fashioned
Southern hospitality prevailed in town and country, and
we who were fortunate enough to live there “Befo de
wah” think no other can ever equal it, no other town can
ever boast of such beautiful girls, such handsome boys,
such noble women, such brilliant men.</p>

<p>When the war cry sounded, Captain A. C. Pickett, a
fine lawyer and an old Mexican War veteran, made up our
company, and called it the “Jackson Guards.” This company
to the number of one hundred and twenty was formed
of the best boys of the county. Sons of plantation-owners,
lawyers, doctors, druggists, merchants,—the whole
South rose as one man, to defend its rights. The young
men, many of us barely twenty years of age, knew nothing
of war. We thought we could take our trunks and
dress suits. We besieged Capt. Pickett and nearly drove
him to distraction with questions as to how many suits we
should take. He nearly paralyzed us by telling us to leave
behind all fancy clothes, and to take only one suit, a woolen
top shirt and two suits of underwear.</p>

<p>The noble women of Jacksonport made our flag. The
wife of Judge Robinson bought the silk in Memphis. Mrs.
Densford made the stars and all the ladies, old and young,
worked on it, for love of those who were to bear it in battle.</p>

<p>On the Fifth of May, 1861 we were ready. It was a
gloomy day. The rain poured in torrents, but our company
formed and marched to the Presbyterian church where
the flag was to be presented. Every living soul in town
was there, streets, yard and church overflowed with people,
notwithstanding the rain. We had seats reserved for
us, and felt very grand as we watched the young ladies on
the platform. We thought they were the sweetest girls
living, and the most beautiful. Misses Mary Thomas
Caldwell, Fannie Board, Pauline Hudson, and others were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
there. Miss Caldwell presented the colors with a short
and touching speech. Sydney S. Gause received it in the
name of the company, replying beautifully. There was
not a dry eye in the throng. Mothers were there
who saw their sons perhaps for the last time. Fathers
bade adieu to noble boys whom they had brought
up to manly deeds of honor. Sisters separated from
brothers. Sweethearts gave farewell to those whom
they would love unto death. Who would not be
moved to tears? We marched to the boat, and on the
bank we stopped to give a last embrace to mother, wife
sister, sweetheart. That spot was hallowed with the
tears that dropped upon the ground.</p>

<p>The boat was the Mary Patterson, named for an Augusta
lady, wife of one of our great lawyers. Its owner,
Captain Morgan Bateman with great generosity, offered
to take us to Memphis. He was a man of commanding
ability, or he could never have handled so many wild
young men. He never received a cent for his liberality,
but he did not care. (He afterwards came back and made
up a company of his own, with the assistance of his brother
who went with him.)</p>


<p>When we were on board at last the boat pulled off
from shore, amid waving handkerchiefs and shouts,
“Good-bye, good-bye,” and no one present ever forgot
that day.</p>

<p>We had with us an Italian Band which had come up
from New Orleans and became stranded in Jacksonport.
It was a great band and afforded us much pleasure until
we got to Memphis.</p>

<p>At every town, landing and woodpile there was a
crowd to cheer us. At Grand Glaize there happened a
near-tragedy, which was averted by Captain Pickett
and Captain Morgan. When we reached Des Arc,
from which place we expected to march overland to Little
Rock, Captain Pickett received a telegram from the governor
to send in by wire our votes for Colonel of the Regiment
and then proceed to Memphis. By Captain’s Pickett’s
advice our company voted for Flournay. The rest of
the Regiment voted for Fagin, who was elected. Fagin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
ever afterward felt hard toward Captain Pickett.</p>

<p>We arrived at Memphis Thursday, May 9th. We
marched to the Fair Grounds to await the arrival of the
rest of the Regiment, and were put into the same quarters
with an Irish Regiment from Tennessee.</p>

<p>I was put on guard inside the Fair Grounds. It rained
all night, I had on new pump-soled boots, and being
by mistake, left on duty, these tight boots caused me considerable
pain. When the sergeant asked me how long I
had been on duty I answered “all night.” He informed
me that I should have been on guard only two hours. I
thought it a part of the game to stay on all night. So
much for being a soldier fool!</p>

<p>The next day we were organized and officers were
elected for the twelve months. They were.</p>

<p>When the captain took charge there were only two
men in the company who knew anything about military
tactics or could even keep step. We stayed in Memphis
four days. On Sunday afternoon with our new banner
proudly waving, we marched through Memphis to the depot
of the Memphis and Charleston Railway, where we
entrained for Richmond, Va. Along the line of march
were thousands of people and at every station was shown
such enthusiasm as was never before known in the South.
Everyone came down to greet us. Old men and women,
young girls, even the negroes. We were showered with
bouquets. We were delayed at different stations by the
crowds. They came to see the Arkansas Troops, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
hear Captain Bob Crockett speak. He was a conspicuous
character from the manner of his dress, and also a celebrity
from being a grandson of old David Crockett, hence
was often called on for a speech. On one occasion, however,
some of the soldiers asked several citizens to call
for Private J. R. Fellows, one of the best orators in the
South. He so far eclipsed Captain Crockett that the latter
ever after took second place.</p>


<p>We passed through Knoxville and Bristol, debatable
territory because Etheridge Brownlow and Andy Johnson,
Union men of great ability and influence, lived in
these places. To say there were hot times in these old
towns would be putting it mildly—“red hot” would be
about right.</p>

<p>At Bristol John M. Waddell took sick and I was detailed
to stay with him at the hotel to which he was carried.
He was delirious and kept calling for his mother,
who lived in North Carolina. He was a Christian boy, and
was ready to die, but how natural to want his mother in
his distress. But he got better and we resumed our journey
to Richmond, where we rejoined our regiment. We
camped in the fair ground and were reviewed often by
President Davis at dress parade.</p>

<p>I think that to him we must have looked very cheap
indeed. We did not know what discipline was, and resented
being shown. The boys used to steal through the lines
and spend most of their time in the city. Bill Barnes
drew some pictures of “Company G in Richmond,” which
caused quite a little trouble at home.</p>

<p>We went from Richmond to Fredericksburg and there
camped in the city awhile. We then moved to Brooks Station,
and at this camp had cadets from Richmond to drill
us. And I should say they did drill us! Eight hours a
day, with a big gun, knapsack and accoutrements weighing
us down, the hot sun blazing over us. How we did
perspire! We were not used to such strenuous exercise.
The town boys, clerks and young fellows could stand it
better than the robust country boys, and that seemed
queer to us.</p>

<p>At this camp John M. Waddell took sick with measles.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
The Regiment lost over fifty men from this disease.
Waddell was discharged and went home. After
his recovery he joined a North Carolina Regiment, and
served with them through the war. He Was a gentleman
in the truest sense of the word. We hated to lose him.
From Brooks Station we went to Aquia Creek, and from
there to Marlboro Point on the Potomac. We camped at
a point where this beautiful stream was four miles wide.
W. M. Maltens, our company color-bearer waded into the
river and unfurled our flag, the handsome silk one given
us by the Jacksonport ladies. “Jackson Guards” was
very plain upon it, and it was displayed in full sight of
the enemy’s war vessels. We were lined up on the bank
to defend our colors. This shows how green we were in
knowledge of warfare and we realized it later.</p>

<p>From Fredericksburg, five companies of our Regiment
and five companies of Col. Bates’ Second Tennessee
Regiment were under Col. Cary. He was a West Pointer,
a fine man and officer, but he certainly did drill us eight
hours every day. During drill our orderly sergeant, a
regular army man, used to prompt us when new moves
were given. One morning he was angry at Captain Pickett.
When Col. Cary gave the command “Double quick
by companies” there was no prompting and Captain
Pickett failed to repeat the command. The sergeant had
his revenge for we were double-quicking by fours to the
line on the right and proceeded by ourselves. Col. Cary
shouted “Captain Pickett, where are you going with your
company?” amid the laughter of the rest of the regiment.</p>

<p>At this camp Bill Shackelford used to go fishing for
crabs in the Potomac. He would miss roll-call and have
to serve extra duty. The boys begged him to stop this
but he said if he could get crabs to eat he did not mind
extra duty. One night Bill had some fun at the expense
of the officer whose duty it was to pass through the tents
and see that all were in bed. We had a big Sibley tent
in which twenty-two men slept. As the officer passed
through the tent, Bill who was a ventriloquist, squealed
like a pig. Of course the officer looked everywhere for
the pig. As he passed to the other side of the tent Bill
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
barked like a dog. Then the officer asked for the man
that did it. Of course all were asleep and knew nothing
about it. He said he would arrest the entire company if
it occurred again. Bill did not try it again.</p>

<p>One day Clay Lowe had cooked some corn-bread and
left it on the table, feeling that he had done a good piece
of work. After dinner a big man in uniform stepped up
and broke open a piece of bread. Clay was about to call
him to account in words not very choice, when the big
man explained that he was General Holmes, commander
of the troops. Clay had to beg his pardon and salute the
General, and the General in return complimented Clay on
his bread.</p>

<p>At this camp we had jumping matches. Bob Bond
was our champion and no one could beat him in the whole
command of one thousand troops, and he was never beaten
in the army.</p>

<p>We also gave dances, and tied handkerchiefs on the
arms of the smallest boys to take the part of ladies in
making up square dances. Joe Hamilton, Rich Hayden
and Billie Barnes were as fine musicians as any and we
often had hilarious times along the Potomac.</p>

<p>On July 17th, 1861, we were ordered to cook three
days’ rations, and be ready at daylight to join our regiment
and march to Manassas Gap. We marched forty-seven
miles and on July 21, were camped in an orchard at
the extreme right of our army, with orders to be ready
at a moment’s notice. We were in line of battle all afternoon
and chafed to be in the fight. We could hear the
cannonading. It seems that the courier who was bringing
our orders to move at once was captured and we did
not get the command. “The third time is the charm” and
finally the third courier brought news of the battle with
orders to double-quick eight miles. We made this in one
hour and forty minutes. On this hot July day the red
dust stirred up by our running made us look like red men.
We hardly knew the features of our file leader. While on
this run we saw some sizzling looking things streaming
through the air. One of the boys said, “Captain, what are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
those things going through the air?” Captain Pickett
replied, “You damned fool, you will know soon.”</p>

<p>We got there in the nick of time. We were thrown
into line of battle and could see in front of us the enemy,
with glistening bayonets, forward marching, line after
line of them. We had a four gun battery, belonging to
Holmes’ Brigade, commanded by Captain Walker. He
was ordered to place his guns on a small hill in our front.
He unlimbered and was ready for action. We were ordered
to load our guns and lie down behind the battery to
protect it if charged. The captain gave the order to fire
upon some Yankees who were advancing boldly. As he
gave the order he was sitting on his big horse with his
feet across the horse’s neck. The first shot did not reach
the spot; so he got down, sighted the gun himself, and
got back on his horse to watch the result. As the shot
plowed through the enemy’s ranks it looked like cutting
wheat, and the Captain said: “Give them hell.” The
four guns made roads through them and with the Infantry
on the other flank they could not stand the fire. The
Yankees broke in every direction and never did stop. As
this was their last stand we moved forward, and the
Black Horse Cavalry passed. This was the finest cavalry
I ever saw. All the horses were black and the uniforms
of the men were handsome to behold. After the Cavalry
Johnson, Beauregard and President Davis with all their
staff, were near us, and the sight was beautiful. We
turned the flank of the enemy and the Black Horse Cavalry
did the rest. The first battle of Manassas was a
great battle and a perfect success.</p>

<p>After the break we were ordered to be down in line
of battle and await orders. Part of the Washington Battery
was near us. This was an organization of fine boys
from New Orleans. After fighting all day they had become
separated, part of their battery being in one part of
the field, and part in another. After the battle they were
hunting their comrades and trying to get the full battery
together. Such chatter! Such individual accounts of the
battle! They told us of their share in the fight. How
they fought the enemy from rear and front and side, and
how the Yankees had run off! It was inside history of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
the battle from privates who were in it. The whole truth
of the first battle of Manassas is this: It was fought by
undisciplined troops, without previous experience in battle,
on a field they had never trod before. They fought as
individuals, and if the officers had not been with them
they would have fought just the same.</p>

<p>This was proved, for had they been disciplined troops
they would have surrendered when cut off from their
command, but not having any better sense they did not
know when they were whipped. On this field they fought
regular army troops with all the advantage of years and
experience. Even our General was doubtful and thought
they could not cope with the great army of Scott. But
when he saw the Southern boys in action, he saw what,
to this day, is the wonder of the world, that we were not
to be whipped in six months.</p>

<p>This battle was a hard rap to those who intended to
profit by it had it gone the other way. The Grand Army
left Washington commanded by the invincible General
Scott, having placards on their hats bearing the motto,
“On to Richmond.” Congressmen, with their wives followed,
together with the elite of Washington, all riding
in carriages. They also wore badges with the ever-ready
slogan, “On to Richmond.” They had trunks plastered
with the same motto. They carried champagne and were
ready for the celebration of a great fete when they should
have witnessed the downfall of the Confederacy. Before
the battle it was a holiday for them, with their wine, and
their hope of an easy rout of the rebels, and the pleasant
anticipation of the capture of soldiers and congressmen of
the Confederacy. But after the battle—ah, it was no holiday
then! What a blow to their pride was the result.
How they tore back to Washington. Their own account
of the first battle of Manassas was truly pitiful. We
could have easily gone into Washington, but at that time
we did not want to go into their territory, all we desired
was to defend our own homes, property and states, which
were ours according to the constitution.</p>

<p>At daylight we marched to Dumfries, thirty miles
back from the station, then to Culpepper court house, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
from there to the pine thicket back from Evansport.
With us were Captain Walker’s battery (Captain Walker
afterwards became General of Artillery) and the
Thirteenth North Carolina Infantry. With their assistance,
working at night with great secrecy, we built batteries
to blockade the Potomac, which was only a mile and
a half wide at this point. We built three batteries in one
mile and mounted large siege guns. The enemy was
greatly astonished on the morning we cut the pine thicket
and laid our guns open to view.</p>

<p>We next made sail boats and tug boats and schooners.
These captured a three masted vessel. When the
tugs came towing it to shore we went out and got it.
Later we had a hard time finding a sailor to set the sails.
Finally one was discovered in our own company, and as
soon as he got on the vessel he ran up the rigging like a
genuine sailor. We found the rooms of the captured vessel
very fancy. It had a piano on board, and a good deal
of nice grub. We unloaded her and then burned her.</p>

<p>We certainly did blockade that river and stop transportation
to Washington by way of the Potomac. Then
the Yankees built a railroad on the opposite side back
from the river and supplied the gap in that manner. We
used to bombard the men over there and kill them and
their six mule teams. This caused consternation as you
may guess.</p>

<p>A small yacht with two on board ran the blockade.
Our batteries opened up on them. The balls exploded
above and around them, sometimes splashing the
water so that we could not see them for the spray. For
awhile it seemed as if we had them, but they got through.
The yacht was so small that we could not hit it. When
they got by, the men waved their hats, as much as to say,
“Goodbye”, but they never tried to repeat the performance.</p>

<p>One night the enemy ran up a creek by the upper battery,
where we had a schooner out and away from the
river. In the darkness they passed our guards and burned
the schooner. The guards were new recruits and very
green. They sent to headquarters to ask what they
could do. Of course the Yanks had plenty of time to get
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
back to the Potomac. We built huts out of logs, placing
them in the side of the hill and roofing them with a foot
and a half of earth to keep out the rain. A few of the
boys had tents, but I think our log huts were more comfortable,
for we covered the floors over with straw. We
passed most of the winter here. Our Maryland boys
used to cross the river in skiffs at night to visit their
homes, and return before daylight.</p>

<p>The Second Tennessee, commanded by Colonel Bates,
camped along with us that winter. One day Colonel
Bates ordered some work done which did not agree with
the dignity of his men. They refused to do it, saying they
“were gentle,” and asking him to resign. He at once
wrote out his resignation and gave it to them. He told
them he would as soon be a private as be an officer. That
a private must obey, and he was as willing to obey any
officer over him as they should be to obey an officer over
them. He was a great man, and a fine speaker. At the
close of his speech they tore up his resignation and re-elected
him colonel.</p>

<p>Colonel Fagin once ordered some boys of our company
to set up his tent but they refused. They came back to
the company and told us about it, also informed Captain
Pickett who went to Colonel Fagin and got them out of it.</p>

<p>So much for raw undisciplined troops.</p>
<p>Christmas was at hand. Our first Christmas in a soldier’s
camp! How homesick we were as we thought of
the people at home and wondered how they were spending
Christmas. Here were their boys fifteen hundred miles
from them, living in dark huts, wading snow a foot and a
half deep. We did not know that the time would come
when these dark, rude huts would seem luxurious quarters.</p>

<p>Our mess was composed of George Thomas, Clay
Lowe, Bob Bond and myself. George had been left behind
at Fredericksburg, where he was ill for some time. He
and a private from another company decided to come to
camp and spend Christmas with the boys. They left the
train and tramped a mile and a half to surprise the mess,
arriving in the nick of time. George said they could not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
bring us turkey, so they brought some whiskey and eggs.
They began beating eggs early Christmas morning, and
they made a huge pan full of egg-nog. We invited the
officers and our friends to take some with us. In the evening
the boys went for Col. Fagin and invited him to drink
egg-nog. By that time they were pretty full and Clay
Lowe told Col. Fagin that he wanted him to understand
that he was “Fifth Sergeant of Company G.” He succeeded
in impressing the Colonel with his rank. Then everyone
began to make things lively.</p>

<p>I did not touch the egg-nog, therefore did not enjoy
their hilarity. I left the hut, found Sam Shoup in his hut,
and we went out and sat by the fire thinking we were
away from the crowd. But the boys did not intend to let
us off so easily. When we came back into the hut we
could not see very well. The cabin was dark, as the only
light came from the doorway, and the snow had blinded
us. The boys made a rush for us. I got into a dark corner,
and after they were all in we both ran out. They
caught Sam, but failed to get me.</p>

<p>Clay Lowe, followed by about twenty-five of the boys,
went down to the middle of the company grounds and
commenced to make a speech, which he could do so well.
Some of the boys, not wishing Clay to have all the glory,
put John Loftin on the stump to make an address and he
began: “My friends, I am not as eloquent as Clay, but I
speak more to the point.”</p>

<p>That evening at dress parade, Sam Shoup as corporal
had to march out and present arms, reporting two commissioned
officers, four non-commissioned officers, and
twenty-seven privates drunk. The rest of the regiment
was there, and to our consternation, we were ordered to
cook three days’ rations and be ready to march at daylight.
The order read that any private who straggled or
failed to keep up with the command would be court martialed.</p>

<p>When we stopped late next evening on the march,
Clay was nearly dead and could hardly walk, from the
effect of the Christmas spree. Colonel Fagin rode along
by our company and seeing how Clay was said, “Hello,
Fifth Sergeant of Company G, how do you feel?” Clay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
replied, “Colonel, I am damned dry; how are you?”</p>

<p>December 26, 1861, we reached Aquia Creek and went
into winter quarters in log huts and tents. Here we had
“Sunday Soldiering.” We were close to Fredericksburg,
and could order what we wanted to eat. Confederate
money was good and we could grab things cheap with it.
Fifty cents a gallon for shelled oysters; twenty-five cents
a pound for butter; pies and cakes every day. Think of
such grub for a soldier! But, ah, to stay in the snow,
eighteen inches deep, and guard the Potomac river all
night! No shelter, but a corn stalk house; no fire, but a
driftwood blaze, not very bright either, as it would be a
signal for the enemy to cannonade. That was like war and
soldier duty.</p>

<p>We had three points to guard on the river, one on the
island with battery, and one at the lower end of the line.
It required a whole company for all points at night, since
the guard had to be relieved every twenty minutes. Otherwise
he would have been frozen by the snow and sleet
which swept across the Potomac.</p>

<p>One night a squad from our company under a sergeant
was ordered to the island, which was only guarded at
night. We had to cross over in a flat boat. The evening
before supplies had been sent to the island for the use of
the Battery Company and they had failed to haul them.
The squad on the lower part of the guard line found them,
all unused, in a pile on the landing. The night was bitter
cold, the snow was deep, the wind blowing a gale, no wood
was in sight. The supplies were bacon. It was good to
eat, and in this emergency it was good to burn, so the
boys proceeded to burn it. Dawn revealed other things
besides bacon. They discovered two jugs of red liquor,
which they immediately confiscated. At daylight they
were ordered to camp two miles away and proceeded to
march—and drink on empty stomachs until the whole
squad was drunk. We, on the upper part of the guard
line, had to wait in the snow and wind until they came
up, for all must report in camp together. We did not
know what caused their delay, but we were in no pious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
frame of mind when we saw them coming, wabbling from
side to side, yelling like Commanches. The officers with
us were red-headed and said things to that squad that
“were bad”.</p>

<p>But the boys from the lower end knew how dry the
officers were after being out all night, so they offered the
jug of snake bite medicine. The officers found it so good
they did not let it go in a hurry. After that the privates
could not refuse for fear of making the boys angry. By
the time we reached camp almost everybody was overcome.
The officers went to sleep, and when they awoke
they forgot all about discipline. So nobody suffered but
the Battery fellows, and they could never prove who captured
their supplies.</p>

<p>Sometimes a company would buy a barrel of oysters,
take it to their hut and open it, and find in the center a
five gallon jug of red rye. It was so concealed to pass
the provost guard on train. But the boys did even worse.
Seven of them from other commands, went to Fredericksburg,
bought a coffin and filled it with jugs. With sad
faces and measured steps they carried it solemnly to the
train. But the joke was too good to keep. The boys unscrewed
the lid and yelled at the guard. Of course, when
the train returned no one could name the offenders.</p>

<p>But our “Sunday Soldiering” did not last long. The
regiment was composed of one year troops, who now re-enlisted
for three years, or for the war. The re-enlisted
men were ordered to rendezvous at Memphis, to reorganize
the regiment, but later were ordered to Corinth, Mississippi.</p>

<p>The Virginia people had been good to us, and had
tried to make us feel at home. Some of the boys had gone
into society at Fredericksburg, and found it hard to part
from their new friends. George (my old friend, George
Thomas) “had it mighty bad.” He said to me, “Bill, I
must go to Fredericksburg to see my girl. Will you cook
my three days’ rations? I’ll meet you at the train tomorrow.”
“But Pard, how will you get off?” “I’ll ask Col.
Fellows.” He went to Colonel Fellows, who was in charge
that day and told his tale of woe. The colonel was in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
deep sympathy with the boy (perhaps he had had the disease
himself sometime,) and agreed to help him. George
went to Fredericksburg, and the next day I saw him there
with his girl. Our train pulled out, I yelled at him, but
still he lingered. They gazed and gazed at each other, and
it seemed that George did not have the nerve to tear himself
away. Finally they parted and by hard running he
caught the train and stood waving to her until we were
out of sight. The mails were kept hot after that. Poor
George was killed at Atlanta. He was the bravest man
I ever knew, and if he had lived, would have made that
girl a noble husband.</p>

<p>March 17, 1862, at Corinth, Mississippi, the re-organization
of the regiment took place. The newly elected officers
of Company G were:</p>

<ul class="officers1">
<li >Samuel Shoup, Captain.</li>
<li >A. T. Watchell, First Lieutenant.</li>
<li >Clay Lowe, Second Lieutenant.</li>
<li >John R. Loftin, Third Lieutenant.</li>
<li >W. B. Densford, First Sergeant.</li>
<li >Henry Clements, Second Sergeant.</li>
<li >W. H. Reid, Third Sergeant.</li>
<li >George Spaulder, Fourth Sergeant.</li>
<li >Thomas Davis, First Corporal.</li>
<li >John W. Baird, Second Corporal.</li>
<li >T. S. Logan, Third Corporal.</li>
<li >Forrest Dillard, Fourth Corporal.</li>
</ul>

<p>We camped at Corinth, Mississippi, and the army
was under General Beauregard until General Albert
Sydney Johnston arrived. April 4th we marched to
Shiloh, arriving there April 5th. The constant rains had
made the roads so bad that we had to pull the cannon by
hand as the horses mired in the mud. But by this time
we were used to hardships, and nothing discouraged that
superb commander, General Albert Sydney Johnston.
Every soldier loved him and was ready to follow him to
the death. At the battle of Shiloh we were placed in the
Gibson Brigade, Braggs’ Division. On the night before
the battle the Medical Department ordered six men from
each company to report to headquarters for instructions.</p>

<p class="noindent">I was one of the six to report from our company. The
Surgeon General ordered us to leave our guns in camp and
follow behind the company at six paces, as an infirmary
corps to take care of the wounded. We reported our instructions
to Captain Shoup, telling him we would not
leave our guns, as we intended to fight. After hard pleading
Captain Shoup consented. We took our guns and also
looked after the wounded.</p>

<p>At four o’clock in the morning we began the march
on the enemy. Each man had forty cartridges, all moving
accoutrements and three days’ rations. General Johnston
was cheered as he rode by our command and I remember
his words as well as if they had been today, “Shoot low
boys; it takes two to carry one off the field.”</p>

<p>Before we started Captain Scales of the Camden
Company, begged his negro servant to stay in camp at
Corinth, but the old negro would not leave his master.
When we were in line of battle the captain again begged
the negro to return to camp, but he refused to go. Just
after the last appeal the fight began. A cannon ball whizzed
through the air and exploded, tearing limbs from
trees, wounding the soldiers. One man fell dead in front
of the old negro. Then there was a yell, and old Sam
shouted, “Golly, Marster, I can’t stand this,” and set out
in a run for Corinth.</p>

<p>We moved forward with shot and shell, sweeping
everything before us. We drove the officers from their
hot coffee and out of the tents, capturing their camp and
tents. Captain Shoup and John Loftin and Clay Lowe
each got a sword. In the quartermaster’s tent we found
thousands of dollars in crisp, new bills, for they had
been paying off the Yankee soldiers.</p>

<p>Thad Kinman of the 7th Arkansas, who was under
Ellenburg, quartermaster department, had loaded a chest
into a wagon when he was ordered to “throw that stuff
away.” He told us afterwards, “That was one time that
I was sick,” but Ellenburg would not let him keep it.</p>

<p>Our command moved steadily forward for a mile or
more. The Yankees had time to halt the fleeing ones,
form a line of infantry and make a stand in an old road
in a thicket. We were to the left of the thicket, fighting
all the time in this part of the field. I saw Jim Stimson
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
fall, and being on the Infirmary Corps, I went to him. I
cut his knapsack loose and placed it under his head, tied
my handkerchief about his neck, and then saw that he was
dead. I took up my gun again, when in front I saw a line
of Yankees two thousand strong, marching on the flank.
I could see the buttons on their coats. I thought I would
get revenge for my dead comrade, so I leveled beside a
tree, took good aim at a Yankee, and fired. About that
time the Yankees fronted and fired. Hail was nothing to
that rain of lead. I looked around and found only four
of our company. One was dead, two were wounded and I
was as good as dead I thought, for I had no idea I could
ever get away. To be shot in the back was no soldier’s
way, so I stepped backward at a lively pace until I got
over the ridge and out of range, assisting the wounded
boys at the same time. I had not heard the command to
oblique to the right and close up a gap, and that was how
we four happened to be alone in the wood. But I did
some running then, found my regiment at the right of
the thicket and fell into rank. When I got there the company
was in a little confusion through not understanding
a command, whether they were to move forward or oblique
to right. Captain Shoup thought his men were
wavering, so he stepped in front of the company, unsheathed
his new sword and told the boys to follow him.
He had scarcely finished with the words when a bullet
struck his sword and went through wood and steel. The
boys were red-headed. They told him he did not have to
lead them. They were ready to go anywhere. So we
went forward into the hottest of the battle where the roar
of musketry was incessant, and the cannonading fairly
shook the ground. Men fell around us as leaves from the
trees. Our regiment lost two hundred and seventy, killed,
wounded and captured. The battle raged all day and
when night came the enemy had been pushed back to the
verge of the Tennessee river. But our victory had been
won at a great price, in the loss of our beloved General,
Albert Sydney Johnston, who was killed early in the action.</p>

<p>General Beauregard, next in command, succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
Johnston, and the battle opened again at daylight the
next morning. During the night the enemy had been
strongly re-inforced, and our men were steadily pressed
back.</p>

<p>John Cathey, John R. Loftin, Waddell and I were among
the wounded. We were sent to the field hospital
several miles back in the wood. When the Surgeon General
went to work on me he gave me a glass of whiskey,
saying it would help me bear the pain. I told him I would
not drink it. He then handed me a dose of morphine. I
refused that. He looked me squarely in the face, saying,
“Are you a damned fool?”</p>

<p>Our men, fighting stubbornly all the while, were pushed
back by superior force through and beyond the Yankee
camps we had captured so easily the day before, and
at last retreated to Corinth, amidst a terrible storm of
rain and sleet. We had lost about ten thousand men.
That was the beginning of our real soldiering and the
greatest battle we had been in. About thirty thousand
men were killed, wounded and captured in those two days,
the loss on each side being fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>At Corinth we awaited re-inforcements and prepared
to renew the struggle. The Yankee forces advanced to
Farmington, and we had a little more fighting. They captured
one of our outposts, then we drove them back to
their lines. Colonel Fellows was always on the front line.
At this battle he plunged after some cavalry, following
them he struck low, boggy ground. He got stuck in the
mud and lost his hat, but succeeded in capturing the enemy.</p>

<p>We kept heavy guards at night. One night eighteen
of our company were put on out-post, but our cavalry was
still further out. George Thomas and I were stationed
inside a fence row. We were told not to fire, and we were
to be relieved before daybreak. We were not relieved
however, and when day came we found ourselves only a
short distance from the Yankee breastworks. We could
have kept concealed by the grass and bushes, but George,
who knew not the meaning of fear, stood in his corner of
the fence-row. As he watched the Yankees walking their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>
beats on the breastworks he thought it a good opportunity,
and before I knew it, he had shot his man. Oh, then
three cannon and two thousand infantry turned loose on
us! The fence was knocked to smithereens. The rails,
filled with bullets, crashed over us. Limbs falling from
trees, covered us, and we were buried beneath the debris
like ground hogs. We could not get out until darkness
fell again. Then we found some of our cavalry, and tried
to get back to our regiment, but the Yanks were between
us and our command. The cavalry said we could fight
our way through their lines, and we did. The cavalry soon
left us behind. Yankees were shooting all around us and
yelling for us to surrender, but we ran into a ravine,
where we were hidden by the thick undergrowth, and so
we got away.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1862, General Beauregard evacuated Corinth.
We retreated on a dark night through a densely
wooded bottom road. About two o’clock we halted. As
soon as we stopped we dropped in the road anywhere, anyhow,
and were fast asleep. Some devilish boy got two
trace chains and came running over the sleeping men,
rattling the chains, yelling “Whoa! Whoa!” at the top
of his voice. Of course all the commotion—we had it
then. Soldiers grasped the guns at their sides, officers
called, “Fall in, fall in men.” When the joke was discovered
it would have been death to that man, but no one
ever knew “who struck Billy Patterson.”</p>

<p>We marched forty miles and camped at Twenty Mile
Creek on the Mobile and Ohio railroad. On June 5th we
reached Tupelo. We were put in Anderson’s Division of
General Walker’s Brigade and camped at Tupelo until
August 4th, when we were ordered to Montgomery, Ala.</p>

<p>We went on the train to Mobile. Here I went up into
the city with Colonel Snyder and two of his friends, I
being the only private among them. It seemed ages since
we had enjoyed a square meal. We went into a fine restaurant
near the Hotel Battle House, four half-starved
Confederate soldiers. Just at the smell of oyster stew I
collapsed. But we ordered everything—oysters raw,
fried, stewed, fresh red snapper; just everything. We ate.
I hope we ate! I think that proprietor was astounded,
but it was only our pocketbooks that suffered. At last
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
when we could eat no more, we had fine cigars, and as
Dr. Scott said later, “This was good enough for a dog.”</p>

<p>We went from Mobile to the railroad station on the
bay, where the water flows under the platform. The train
was two hours late, so the boys shed their clothes, and in
ten minutes there were a thousand men in the bay. They
swam about splashing, kicking, diving, having fun until
some of the boys went in where the palm flags were growing
and espied a large alligator with his mouth wide open.
In less time than it takes to tell it there was not a soldier
in the bay. Strange! Men, who had stood firm in
battle, had faced cannon, had endured shot and shell, now
fled from one alligator!</p>

<p>We went by rail to Montgomery, where we arrived
August 7th. We went into camp near the river and had a
chance to swim without fear of alligators.</p>

<p>Montgomery, as the first capital of the Confederacy,
was a noted place and many celebrated people lived there.
Dr. Arnold and I had bought ourselves “boiled” white
shirts, thinking we might be invited into society, but we
seemed to have been forgotten by the “haut ton.” But it
was a beautiful city and we inspected it thoroughly. We
were too many for the police, so they “gave us rope to
hang ourselves.”</p>

<p>We went on next day to Atlanta. When we got there
we hoped to eat a big Georgia watermelon, but to our
consternation, found the provost guard destroying every
watermelon in the city. They were fresh, red and juicy
and made our mouths water, but discipline had improved
and we touched not, tasted not, handled not the unclean
watermelons. The doctor said they would make us
sick. Citizens and negroes might eat them. For soldiers
they were sure poison.</p>

<p>We passed up the Sequatchie Valley with its fine
springs, stone milk houses, and rich bottom land. We
camped on Cumberland Mountain and we camped on Caney
Fork. We marched thirty-five miles to Sparta, Tennessee,
and camped, and there we were ordered to wash
our clothes and to cook three days’ rations. All this
marching was on the famous Bragg Kentucky Campaign
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
and the old general trained us to walk until horses could
not beat us. We marched eleven, twelve, thirteen____
____fifty miles. We waded the Cumberland river, and it
was very swift and deep. My messmate, Bob Bond, found
a sweetheart here, but he could not tarry and they parted
in tears. We camped at Red Sulphur Springs, marched
thirty-eight miles and camped on the Tennessee and
Kentucky line. We passed through Glasgow, marching
all night. These forced marches were hard on us, seasoned
infantry as we were. Dr. Arnold, my file leader said:</p>

<p>“Bill, I can’t go any further, don’t you see I go to
sleep walking? I can’t stand it any longer.”</p>

<p>“You’re no good,” I replied, “you can stand it as well
as I can, besides if you leave the road you will be captured
and will have to eat rats.”</p>

<p>“Goodbye, old friend, I am gone,” was his answer.
He ran into the wood twenty or thirty feet from the road,
dropped down and was asleep by the time he hit the
ground.</p>

<p>He said when he awoke he heard sabres clashing and
cavalry passing. He thought he “was a goner”, but he
soon heard the familiar voice of General Hardee. He was
calling to get up and go on. He said even a soldier’s endurance
had a limit, and that limit was now reached. We
would not go much further without a rest. Then he ordered
his body guard to charge the sleeping men. Dr. Arnold
had to run for his command or be court martialed. Panting
for breath, he joined us after we had gone into camp,
and exclaimed, “Bill, I wish I had come on, for I am nearly
dead, and old General Hardee is after me hot and
heavy.”</p>

<p>On September 17th we left Case City at daybreak,
and marched fifteen miles to Mumfordsville, which we
surrounded, placing a battery on every hill and knoll that
commanded the town. We had eighty cannon ready to
open fire, and then demanded the surrender of the garrison,
and on September 18th six thousand men marched
out, laying down six thousand guns. While Will Reid of
our company was loading guns into a wagon, one went
off accidentally and shot off his arm. General Hardee was
riding over the battlefield, and seeing Reid with his arm
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
dangling at his side asked his staff surgeon, Dave Yandell,
“Who is that man’s surgeon?” Yandell pointed out
Dr. Young. Dr. Young had gone out in our company a
graduate surgeon. He was young and up to that time he
had made no operation of note. He begged the staff-surgeon
to help him, but Yandell refused, saying he had no
time. He stayed, however, to look on, and embarrassed
the young surgeon still more. When Dr. Young took the
knife his hand shook like a leaf, but he performed the operation
successfully and according to all the laws of surgery.
After the war he returned to his home at Corinth,
Mississippi, where he stood high in his profession. He
died in 1892.</p>

<p>At Mumfordsville while in line of battle, marching
slowly and stopping often, we passed through an orchard.
Nice juicy apples were lying all over the ground and one
of the boys of a Louisiana Regiment, stooped down and
picked up two or three. His colonel happened to be looking
in his direction, and he had that boy gagged and buckled
every time the line stopped. After that every soldier
thought hell was too good for that colonel.</p>

<p>On the 20th we marched all night and camped at daylight
at New Haven. On the 21st we marched seventeen
miles, and camped at Haginsville. On the 22nd we passed
fine orchards. My partner, Dr. Arnold said to me, “If
you will carry my surplus luggage, I will take the risk and
get some of those apples.” “Now Pard, you are in for
more trouble.” But he would not listen, and taking his
blanket to hold the apples he started off.</p>

<p>He was not the only soldier under the trees, and
while on a limb getting his share of the apples, lo and behold,
the provost guard came to arrest them! He fairly
fell from the tree, broke through the high corn and ran
for his life, the guard calling after, “Halt, or I shoot.”</p>

<p>He got back to us with the fruit but said the apples
had cost him so much labor and so much fright that they
did not taste good. Because we laughed at him, running
with his load, he would not give us any until the next day.</p>

<p>We marched fifteen miles and camped at Bardstown
until October 4th, when we marched seventeen miles. We
marched twelve miles and camped at Springfield. The
heat was terrible on those long sunny pikes, with never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
a sign to mark the grave of a hero, noble sacrifice to their
cause.</p>

<p>One day an assistant surgeon carrying an umbrella
was marching along the pike in the rear of his regiment
when General Hardee came along. The General had nothing
to shield him from the sun but a little cap. He rode
up to the surgeon and said, “What is your name?”</p>

<p>The man told him his name, rank and regiment.</p>

<p>“Well sir,” said General Hardee, “just imagine this
whole army with umbrellas.”</p>

<p>The doctor shut up his umbrella and pitched it over
into the field.</p>

<p>General Hardee was always joking his men on the
march, but when the fight was on no one did his part better
than he.</p>

<p>On October 6th we marched through Perryville, but
on the 7th we marched back and camped in the main
street of the town.</p>

<p>Some of the boys stole a bee-hive and many of them
got stung so their faces were swollen and eyes closed.
Dr. Arnold was one of the injured ones, but he did not fail
to eat his honey. As we lay on the ground that night I
teased him, saying General Hardee would need no further
proof; that he carried his guilt in his face. The doctor
did not relish this so I turned over to go to sleep when a
bee stung me on the cheek.</p>

<p>“Who’s the guilty one now?” laughed the doctor and
the joke was surely on me. But I knew where the medicine
wagon was, and went and got some ammonia. I
bathed my face, and the swelling went down at once, so I
came out ahead after all.</p>

<p>By daylight we were in line of battle and honey and
bee-stings were forgotten. The Battle of Perryville was
fought October 8th, 1862. We were on the extreme left
and our battery, on a hill at our rear, was not engaged until
late in the day. The heaviest fighting was on the extreme
right. Both sides were contending stubbornly for
a spring of water between the lines and were dying for
water. Sometimes one side would have the advantage,
sometimes the other. When called into action we crossed
a bridge in the center of the town, formed a line and advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
to the top of the hill. Our battery was planted
and had begun its work when we received orders to recross
the bridge and occupy our former lines. We had to
retreat under battery fire, and after we had got our battery
over the bridge we marched along the pike. The enemy
opened on us with grape and cannister and did deadly
work. We double-quicked into line and their sharp-shooters
gave us a terrible assault from behind the
houses. But when our line was formed, our sharp-shooters
deployed and our battery opened fire, they had to retreat.
So the battle went on, but finally we had to give up
the struggle and evacuate the town. The loss was heavy
on both sides, about eight thousand men being killed, captured
and wounded.</p>

<p>October 9th we marched fifteen miles and passed
Harrodsburg. On the 10th we marched sixteen miles to
Camp Dick Robinson. Here a council was held while General
Bragg gave his wagons time to go South. It was the
greatest wagon train ever seen in the army; was three
days passing at one point. Here George Thomas and I
each bought three yards of undyed jeans to make ourselves
some trousers when we got back South.</p>

<p>The defeat at Perryville and the failure of the Kentuckians
to join us as we had hoped, made our campaign
anything but a brilliant success from a military point of
view, notwithstanding our victories at Mumfordsville and
Richmond.</p>

<p>But we had captured six thousand men, we had secured
arms and ammunition which were sorely needed, we
had gotten enormous quantities of supplies which were a
great help to the Confederacy, and the men who did get
back were tough as whit-leather, ready for anything.</p>

<p>October 13th we marched twenty-three miles, passing
through Lancaster, October 14th we marched seventeen
miles, going through Mount Vernon, and halted a
little before dark.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold and I went down to a creek about a mile
from camp, and there in a field we found a fine pumpkin.
He said if I would help him cook it I might help him eat it.
He said it would have to cook until one o’clock to be well
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
done. I told him I would help take it to camp but I’d be
dinged if I’d stay up until one o’clock to cook it. I was
too nearly dead for rest and sleep. We got it to camp, cut
it up, put it in the famous old army camp kettle and Doc
began the Herculean task of staying awake to cook his
pumpkin. He did stay awake until one o’clock and got it
nicely done, but was afraid to eat it at that unusual hour,
as he might have cramp colic. He found an old fashioned
oven with a lid, put his pumpkin into it, fastened the lid,
placed the oven under the knapsack beneath his head and
went to sleep. But first he took the trouble to wake me
and tell me I should not have a bite of his pumpkin because
I would not stay up to help him cook it.</p>

<p>When reveille sounded he woke up and began to guy
me, saying “You shall not have a bite.” He took up his
knapsack and behold, the oven, pumpkin and all, was
gone! Oh, he was furious, and fairly pawed the ground.
He thought I had taken it for a joke, but soon found that
to be a mistake. We decided that some soldier had stolen
and eaten it. If he had found the man he would have
fought him to a finish. He never did see the joke.</p>

<p>October 19th we marched eleven miles. We passed
over a battlefield, where General Buckner had fought, and
crossed Wild Cat River. We marched thirteen miles and
passed through Barkersville. This was a strong Union
town in the mountains. The “Jay Hawkers” shot at us
from the top of the mountains; women and boys pelted
us with stones, shouting, “Hurrah, for the Union.” As
they were women and children, we had to take it.</p>

<p>Once we were marching on a road cut out of the
mountain side. On one side was a cliff of solid rock, on
the other a deep precipice. The command to halt was given
and the men fell down to rest, completely filling the
road. Arnold and I were in the rear, and one of the ambulance
drivers, seeing the crowded condition of the road,
told us to get up with him, which we did. There was a
trail just wide enough for the horsemen, single file, and
along this trail rode General Hardee looking after his
men. When he reached this ambulance he stopped opposite
Arnold and said to him, “Are you sick?” “No, sir.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
“Well, get down off that wagon.”</p>

<p>“Are you sick?” he called to me, but by that time I
was out on the ground. Then he said to the driver, “Let
no soldier ride unless he is sick or wounded.”</p>

<p>A Kentucky Colonel brought with him his five hundred
dollar carriage, and had his negro drive it at the
rear of the regiment. In his rounds General Hardee had
found some sick men and told them to get into that carriage.
The negro and rear officers explained whose carriage
it was, but the General only said, “No use going
empty when it can serve so good a purpose. By tomorrow
perhaps none of us will need it.”</p>

<p>So the umbrella man, Arnold and myself were not the
only ones upon whom General Hardee kept an eye.</p>

<p>October 19th we marched fourteen miles, crossed
Cumberland River, then on through Gibraltar, Cumberland
Gap, and on across Powell River into Tennessee. We
marched past Taswell, crossed Clinch River at Madisonville,
and, on October 24th, camped about six miles from
Knoxville. Here we were given time to wash and dry our
clothes. On this raid we had only one suit and to get it
clean meant to strip, wash, let the clothes dry on or hang
them on bushes to dry, while we waited. With our battles
and forced marches we could not stop for that; so
creeping companions were large and furious, and made
deadly war. But at Knoxville everybody got busy, went
into warfare with our creeping enemy, and the thousands
destroyed in that fierce combat will never be known.</p>

<p>George Thomas and I brought out our white jeans
which we had bought in Camp Dick Robinson, and had
carried all these miles. We got some copperas from a
kind old rebel lady, took walnut hulls and dyed our cloth.
It was a good job too.</p>

<p>The boys were getting short on tobacco, and it looked
as if the whole army would be forced to reform on this
line. But they borrowed Dr. Ashford’s horse and sent me
to buy tobacco, chewing tobacco, smoking tobacco, hand
tobacco, giving me plenty of Confederate currency.</p>

<p>I rode into the beautiful town which I had not seen
since we were flying into Virginia. Then we wore good
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
clothes and had Sunday Soldiering. Now we were soldiers
with the dust of a thousand mile march, ragged and
unkempt, bleeding from the wounds of two hard-fought
battles and numerous skirmishes. Then we were raw, undisciplined
troops, now we were seasoned veterans. Such
was the change in a few short months.</p>

<p>Riding to a drug store, I hitched my horse, went in,
and bought my wholesale bill of tobacco. When I came
out again to the sidewalk I saw a policeman leading off
my horse. I yelled at him to stop, but he went on, I rushed
up and grabbed the reins. He told me it was against
the law to hitch a horse to a post in that city. About that
time twenty of our boys came running to my rescue.
They lined up and told the policeman to turn the horse
loose. He did the wise thing, or there would have been a
“hot time” right there. I took the horse and I made a bee-line
for General Braggs’ Brigade, and took joy and delight
to my tobacco-starving friends.</p>
<p>November 2nd we passed through Knoxville and
camped on the railroad. At daylight the 154th Regiment
Band awoke us with the sweetest music I ever heard. It
brought back such poignant memories of home, of the
boys and girls around the piano, of charming plantation
melodies.</p>

<p>But the next tune was not so sweet. It came to the
tune of orders to “cook three days’ rations, and be ready
to move at a moment’s notice.” We rode cars to Chattanooga,
from there on November 10th we went to Bridgeport,
Alabama. From Bridgeport we crossed the Tennessee
River, marched fifty miles and camped at Alisonia.
November 24th we marched twenty miles, passing
through Tullahoma; November 25th we marched fifteen
miles and camped on Duck River at a short distance from
Shelbyville. At this time the Medical department decided
to give all the one-course Medical students then in the
army a chance to pass the examination for promotion to
assistant surgeon. Dr. Arnold was one of these one-course
students and decided to try the examination. We
diked him out in the best clothes we could get together in
the company. I contributed my white shirt, other boys
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
brought him hat, coat, shoes, and collar. When he stood
before us for inspection he could have passed for a lawyer
or preacher just from town. With his book, “Smith’s
Compends,” he walked twenty miles to the Board of Examiners,
stood before the “saw-bones,” shook and answered
questions. Perhaps his borrowed plumage helped
him, at any rate he passed, and was given a certificate.
He walked back, changed from the rank of a private to
that of a captain! When he came in sight two hundred
braves met him; when shown his certificate they rode
him on a rail and kept up a rough house for an hour or
two. He had no horse, no money, and no books except his
Smith’s Compends, but the older doctors helped him, and
soon he was fully up in medical affairs and made a good
surgeon too.</p>

<p>December 8th we marched twenty miles and camped
at Eaglesville. From there we marched to College Hill.</p>

<p>December 28th we marched to Murfreesboro, and
camped on Stone River within cannon shot of the town.
Here we prepared to meet Rosecrans with his army, forty-five
thousand in number. We were in line of battle on
the extreme right. After dark on the thirtieth, still in
line of battle, we moved our position to extreme left and
camped, without fire, in a cedar rough. Our orders were
to advance as soon as it was light enough to see. At
dawn, December 31, we moved promptly on the enemy,
advancing through an open field. The enemy, protected
by a fence and the trees, received us with deadly fire and
our loss was great. But we flew after them and our work
was just as disastrous to them. Dead bluecoats were
thick in every direction. We soon had them on the run.</p>

<p>Our company Color Bearer William Mathews, the
same who had defied the Yankee fleet on the Potomac, had
been ill and this was his first fight. As we followed the
fleeing Yanks he said, “Boys, this is fun.” One of the
men answered, “Stripes, don’t be so quick, this is not over
yet; you may get a ninety-day furlough yet.” In twenty
minutes Mathews’ arm was shot to pieces.</p>

<p>George Thomas was in front of all the company. He
had killed two men and was pulling down on the third,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
when one, but a short distance away, shot him, wounding
him in the arm. But George spotted the man who shot
him and wanted to go on with one good arm. However,
he was taken off the field and sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>We drove the enemy three miles. The fire all along
the line was terrific. The cannonading could be heard for
miles. The rattle of small arms was continuous. Our
line on the left was pressing on over a terrible cedar
rough. Anyone who understands a cedar rough can understand
what that means. Limestone rocks, gnarly
cedar trees, stub arms sticking out of the ground, make
it almost impassable at best. How much more difficult
with an enemy in front concentrating his fire upon
us. We pressed on through rocks and thicket. One
of our brave boys, Arthur Green, was struck by a
cannonball and torn all to pieces. Other parts of the line
were as hot as ours. We got possession of the thicket but
could not get the cannon through it; so we hardly got a
man of their line.</p>

<p>When we got through, we found the Yanks with sixty
cannon in line fronting the cedar rough. Our ranks were
so depleted we could not charge two lines of infantry and
sixty cannon. There was nothing to do but hold our position
and await re-inforcements.</p>

<p>We lay in line all night. Orders were sent to the
quarter-master to send rations, if he had any. Two negroes,
belonging to two of the officers, arrived, bringing
food for their masters.</p>

<p>As all was quiet then, and it was raining, they decided
to sleep by the fire until daylight. To keep off the rain
they drove forked branches into the ground, laid a brace
across them, stretched their blankets over all, and pegged
them to the ground at the four corners. Before long hard
firing was heard on the outpost. Bullets rained on their
tent, struck the logs of the fire, cut loose the corners of
the blankets, letting the rain on their faces. When they
saw the flying bullets, they awaited no instructions from
their masters. With eyes popping out of their heads,
they grabbed their blankets and set out for the wagon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
train. They were not long in getting there.</p>

<p>Next day the struggle was renewed with fearful carnage.</p>

<p>Each side fought with grim and settled purpose, finally
a fierce onslaught scattered our forces. In twenty minutes
we lost two thousand men, and the day was lost.
Orders for retreat were given.</p>

<p>General Braggs’ loss was about ten thousand men,
while Rosecrans reported his at twelve thousand.</p>

<p>In the battle our Lieutenant Colonel Don McGregor
was mortally wounded. When he was taken to the hospital,
his faithful old Samuel was by his side. The Colonel’s
sister, who lived a few miles from Murfreesboro, had come
to relieve the suffering and nurse the wounded. (Ah,
those brave, never-to-be-forgotten daughters of the
South!) When she drove up to the hospital in her carriage
she found Sam waiting with his own and his master’s
horse saddled ready for the trip to her home. When
we retreated General Rosecrans’ men came in, and his
guard took the two horses, and drove off in the carriage.
What could be done? Samuel said, “I will get them back.”</p>

<p>At this particular time of the unpleasantness, the
Yankees were burning with sympathy for the poor, oppressed
negro, and negroes were permitted to do pretty
much as they pleased. Samuel went to Rosecrans’ headquarters,
told him the horses were his, that he had a
wounded friend in the hospital and he wanted a pass to
the country. All his requests were granted. He drove
the Colonel and his sister to her home, and nursed his
master until he died.</p>

<p>After Colonel McGregor died Samuel got a pass
through the lines and returned to our camp. He delivered
the Colonel’s horse but kept his own and asked our
Regiment Colonel for a pass to Arkansas. He then told
the boys to write to their fathers, mothers and sweethearts,
as he was going back home to see his mistress.
We received answers to these letters, showing that Samuel
had made the journey safely, faithful to the end.</p>

<p>We retreated by night. We were nearly starved. It
was raining, cold, cold rain, and we were wet to the skin.
We were so sleepy that if we stopped for a moment we
would go to sleep. We had gone almost as far as human
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
nature could go.</p>

<p>One of the boys thought he would rest a few moments
beside a fire left by some wagons. He took pine boughs
and laid them on the wet ground, dropped down with all
his accoutrements, and went to sleep. General Hardee
came up, spied him, called to his Adjutant, “Roy, come
here; here is a fellow who has gone regularly to bed.”</p>

<p>About then the soldier woke up very much frightened.
He thought he would be shot. He got away from
there in a hurry, and was with his command before his
absence was discovered.</p>

<p>January 5th, 1863, we marched forty-two miles to
Manchester. January 6th we marched eighteen miles to
Alisonia. From Alisonia we marched to Tullahoma, and
there we camped for the winter.</p>

<p>We were in General Hardee’s Division. We had tents
and were comfortable. We drilled four hours a day, and
by way of diversion General Hardee had contests in drilling.
We become so expert that we could have made the
Virginia Cadets ashamed of themselves. Our company
was third best and that took good practice. A Louisiana
company was ahead of us. It beat us in quickness at
“trail arms”, “lie down”, at “double quick.” At walking
or running none excelled us at any army maneuver. We
had other amusements, too. We played “town ball” and
“bull pen” and had some lively games. We dressed up
the smaller fellows as girls and we danced. Joe Hamilton,
Dick Hayden, Sam Shoup and Bill Barnes were the musicians.
Bill Shackleford was ready to play pranks, and
made fun for the crowd. Now and then we got a pass and
sent our best foragers out for “fancy grub” and vegetables.
Then we would have a big dinner and a big day.</p>

<p>April 23rd, real fun began again, but we were alive,
active, young, healthy, well-drilled, well-disciplined—in
perfect fighting trim. For fear we would forget how to
march a walking track was opened up from Tullahoma,
and we marched daily five, ten, eighteen, twenty, thirty
miles, making expeditions to all the surrounding towns—Wartrace,
Bellbuckle, Hoover’s Gap, Duck River, Bridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
Railroad Gap, Manchester. Manchester was a nice little
town in the hills, where there were numerous springs and
streams in which we could swim. June 22nd we went
there to relieve a Louisiana Regiment. When we arrived
they were on dress parade, eleven hundred strong and
their drill was simply fine, but they had never smelt powder
nor marched at all. They wore nice caps, fine uniforms,
white gloves, fine ——shop-made laced high shoes.
They carried fat haversacks and new canteens, fine new
fat knapsacks with lots of underclothing and even two
pairs of shoes. They laughed at us in our shabby dress,
with our dirty haversacks and no knapsacks. We had one
suit of underwear wrapped in our blankets and our accoutrements
were reduced to the lightest weight possible.
They said we were too few to meet the enemy, but we
told them we would stay with any who came to engage us.
We also told them that they couldn’t get through one
week’s campaign with such knapsacks. Some of the boys
said, “We will follow in your wake and replenish our
wardrobes.”</p>

<p>This was a sad camp to us. One of our men, Garret,
got angry with Mr. Bragden, the Beef Sergeant, who divided
the company rations. Taking his gun, he went to
Bragden’s tent where he was unarmed and shot him like
a dog. Garrett would have been lynched if the officers
had not hurried him off to another part of the army.</p>

<p>June 27th we marched to Wartrace, June 29th to Tullahoma,
June 30th we were deployed to build breastworks,
but we retreated at eleven o’clock at night to Alisonia on
Elk River.</p>

<p>July third, we camped in the Cumberland Mountains,
near the school which had been established by General
Polk and the Quintards. It was an ideal place for a school
and I am glad to say it bears, today, an honored name
among educators as the University of the South.</p>

<p>We had marched all day in the hot July sun, clouds of
dust had parched our throats, and we were almost perishing
for water when we reached the spring. As we rested
at the side of the road whom should we see but our crack
Louisiana Regiment—the one we had relieved at Manchester
only ten days before. They were dusty, dirty, lame
and halt, with feet sore and swollen in their tight shoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
a bedraggled and woe begone set of youngsters. How we
joshed them.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, mama’s darling;” “Straighten up and be
men;” “Brace up like soldiers, so the army won’t be ashamed
of you.” These were some of the commands we
hurled at them. They would have fought us if they could
have stopped, but a soldier cannot break ranks.</p>

<p>July 4th, 1863, we camped in the valley on the Tennessee
River. Then we crossed the River at Kelly Ford to
Lookout Valley. July 9th we marched through Chattanooga
and camped at Turner’s Station.</p>

<p>August 17th we marched to Graysville. Here Dr. T.
R. Ashford got a four days’ furlough. Dr. Ashford had
married in Georgia and had gone with his bride to Arkansas
and established himself as a physician. When the
war broke out he joined the army from his adopted home,
going out as assistant surgeon in our regiment. His wife
returned to her mother in Georgia and he had not seen
her for two years. As Graysville was near her home, she
came to visit him and there they had a happy meeting.</p>

<p>Dr. Ashford, always kind and sympathetic, was a
great favorite with the boys. Highly educated and a fine
surgeon, he was modest and unassuming, a sincere Christian
gentleman. After the war he settled in Georgia. Dr.
Ashford, Dr. Arnold and I were close friends through
those long dreadful years.</p>

<p>August 21st we camped at Harrison on the Tennessee
River. On August 23rd we marched fourteen miles and
camped at Gardner’s Ferry.</p>

<p>Here several of the boys went foraging and got some
nice green apples. George Thomas, Captain Shoup and
others made apple dumplings and put them in a large
camp kettle to cook.</p>

<p>They were standing around the fire, with mouths watering,
thinking every minute an hour, when the Yankees
on the other side of the river began to shell the camp.
They had run up four globe-sighting 16 shotguns to the
top of a small hill. We were too far from our guns and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
there were no orders given to shoot, so they shelled us a
plenty.</p>

<p>While the boys were watching the kettle a cannon ball
struck the fire, upset the kettle, passed between the legs
of one of the men and exploded a little farther on. This
did not seem to cause any alarm. They had heard cannon
balls explode before, but a mighty wail went up over
the loss of the apple dumplings. The air was blue around
there, and at that particular moment the boys would have
charged the enemy joyously.</p>

<p>I was with the doctors that day. They had a negro
who was a fine forager. He even brought us fried chicken.
We had a royal spread in front of the doctors’ tent
and were consuming the good things with great relish,
when a cannon ball went through the tent! It looked like
it was going to smash us to smithereens, grub and all!
We got away from there. We grabbed the grub and, went
down the line where we finished our meal. Not royally
as we would have done, but hastily and stealthily.</p>

<p>But our sharp-shooters in the dumps on the river got
even with them. The Yanks drove out into the field with
two six-mule wagons to get some fine rebel fodder. There
were about thirty men in all, teamsters and guards. Some
of them stood on the rail pen surrounding the fodder, others
climbed on the shock to begin at the top. Our sharp-shooters
shot the mules first, then the men, and few lived
to tell the tale. Sherman said, “War is Hell.” In this
case it was hell to them.</p>

<p>September 10th we marched down the valley toward
Lafayette. As the dust was a foot deep and water scarce
we moved slowly and we went into camp about ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Dr. Scott of our Division, was sent for to see a citizen
who was very ill. He went and relieved him, and left
medicine, not asking pay for his services. After he had
returned to camp a negro brought him a huge tray heaped
with good things to eat. The doctor looked at the pile
of grub, and said, “You boys must dine with me today, I
can’t eat all of this.” We needed no further urging for
our blue beef and water corn-dodger was rather poor fare.
We lit into it, and as hungry wolves devour a sheep, so
we devoured that pile of grub. Then the darkey took his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
tray and departed with a note of thanks. Our gratitude
was truly sincere.</p>

<p>September 19th battle was on hand. We were in
General Polk’s Brigade, to which the Hardee Corps had
been transferred. When orders were read we found ourselves
named as reserves. Cannonading began on our
right, and we were moved quickly to the sound of the
shot, about three miles. As we drew nearer to it we were
ordered to double-quick. When we came to Chickamauga
Creek we began to pull off our shoes to wade when General
Cleburne came along saying, “Boys, go through that
river, we can’t wait.”</p>

<p>Through the creek we went, and were among the first
to be engaged instead of being reserves. When our line
was deployed and ordered forward we were the very first.
We struck stubborn western troops who knew how to
fight. The conflict was terrific and raged all day. When
night fell the engagement was stopped. Throwing out
skirmishers we found that the lines were mixed up terribly.
We were among the Yankees and they were calling,
“What command is this?” It was midnight before the
lines were reformed. Then we had a night’s sleep on the
ground, knowing that on the morrow some of us would
fall in defense of our country—some of us would never
see home and mother again. General Longstreet arrived
in the night with re-inforcements, bringing a division
from Virginia. At daybreak the struggle was renewed.
On both sides was the determination, “God being our
helper, we will win this day.” Wave after wave of deadly
lead was sent against those Western troops, who contested
every inch of the ground, who would stand a charge,
and stay on the field. But our blood was hot, we fought
for home, and against an invading foe and we could not
give up at all. At the end of two days a battle of battles
had been fought and won for the Confederate cause. But
alas, how many Southern boys had bitten the dust. The
field was so thickly strewn with dead we could scarcely
walk over it without stepping on the corpses. Our Regiment
lost 42 killed and 103 wounded, and of the 120,000
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
men engaged on both sides, 28,000 were killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>Longstreet’s men said to us, “Boys, you have tougher
men to fight than we.”</p>

<p>If we had followed up our victory and had Forrest cut
off the enemy’s supplies what a difference it would have
made. We might have stretched our lines to the Kentucky
border. Such are the mistakes of war.</p>

<p>At this battle one of the boys captured two horses
and gave them to Dr. Arnold. He said he would draw
feed for them and on the march I could ride one of them.
I named my horse “General Thomas” but before we left
our first camp the assistant surgeons could draw feed only
for one horse so I was afoot as I had been for two years.</p>

<p>We established a line of breastworks on Missionary
Ridge and held Lookout Mountain, a mountain over a
mile in height, and, as we thought, commanded Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The Yankees saw that something must be done or
things would be booming in Dixie. They brought to the
front Dutch, Irish, Hottentots and all kinds of troops, and
by the last of October the Sequatchie (?) (Wauhatchie?)
Valley was swarming like a beehive.</p>

<p>Once a Dutch corps of 15,000 went down the valley
through a gap to reach our rear. Bragg sent to meet
them about 15,000 troops, placing them arrowed in front.
He had a line under General Hindeman with orders, at a
certain signal, to rush across, cutting them off entirely
from the main army. The signal was never given and we
do not know why to this day. At that signal we were to
follow across the valley at double-quick but Mr. Dutch
discovered he was in a trap and he marched out again.</p>

<p>There was a Union man living on the route of this
Dutch Devil, who had not joined either army. He had
lived on his farm unmolested by the Southern troops, and
supposed that of course he would be protected by the
Northern troops. As the Dutch marched down to attack
us they stopped at this man’s home, searched the place,
insulted his wife and knocked him down. As they came
running back they had no time to tarry, but one at a
time, a straggler, would drop into his smokehouse to see
if there was one ham left. The Union man took a long,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
keen bowie-knife and stood in the dark corner of the
smokehouse; when only one man entered he stabbed him
to the heart and put his body into the well. He killed
three men. Next morning, he with his wife and children,
walked into our camp. He said he was ready to fight to
the bitter end. He took his family South and came back
and made a bad soldier for them.</p>

<p>November 23, 24 and 25 we fought the “Battle Above
the Clouds,” the terrible conflict of Lookout Mountain and
Missionary Ridge. We were fighting continuously during
those three days. We were in breastworks on the ridge
near Lookout Mountain, but when the fighting was fiercest
we were sent to relieve the commands at the extreme
right of the Yankee army. They came in solid front five
columns deep and charged our breastworks but were driven
back hour after hour with terrible slaughter. Late in
the afternoon they made a concentrated attack on our
center and drove our men out of line. We had to give up
Lookout Mountain and we retreated to the Ridge about
midnight. Throughout the night Sherman’s troops were
coming up, and next day we were attacked in front and
flank. Our breastworks were of no use as Lookout
Mountain commanded the Ridge, so in spite of desperate
struggles we were ordered to retreat.</p>

<p>At Chattanooga it had been agreed that there should
be no firing on the line of pickets without notification.
Here between the picket line and the main line of battle
our sporting boys sought “sheckle luck,” those who were
fortunate enough to have a few sheckles of Confederate
money. One day when General Hardee was officer of the
day he ordered a regiment deployed around the gamblers,
but soldiers from all parts of the field yelled to the boys
to run, and run they did. General Hardee did not get
many.</p>

<p>In our company was a Kentucky lad named Barnett
who had a brother in the Union Army. They got permission
to spend the day together. When the day was over
they separated, each going back to his command. That
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
was a war! Brother against brother, father against son,
arrayed in deadly combat.</p>

<p>We went to Dalton, marching all night. As we crossed
the river it seemed the coldest night our thinly clad
men had ever experienced. Our corps under Hardee was
the rear guard. General Cleburne’s Division was immediately
in the rear. General Polk was our Brigadier General.
About two o’clock we passed General Cleburne.</p>
<p class="center">[ &hellip; ]</p>
<p class="noindent">mountain, looking and thinking.</p>

<p>“Something is going to happen” I said to the boys.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Look at General Cleburne, don’t you see war in his
eyes?”</p>

<p>We had crossed Ringold Mountain, but we were sent
back to take the horses from the cannon, put men in their
places, and pulled it quickly to the top of the mountain,
so to the summit over rocks and between trees two pieces
were carried. Our regiment was sent to the top with
them. Two minutes more would have been too late. Not
fifty yards away on the other side of the hill were Yankees
climbing for the same goal. Then the firing began.
We had the advantage in having a tree to use as breastworks,
and in being able to see them. Whenever one
stepped aside from his tree to shoot our men got him.
Captain Shoup and John Baird rolled rocks down the hill
and when a Yankee dodged the other boys shot him. We
picked off dozens. When the cannon was got ready and
began shelling the woods, breaking the trees, tearing up
rocks and showering them on the lines below, they had to
break and retreat in haste down the hill.</p>

<p>If we had not got there as soon as we did our line
would have been the one to retreat.</p>

<p>General Cleburne took us next to Ringold Gap, a gap
dug by the railroad through the mountain. He made a
talk to the boys, telling us that we were there to save the
army, which was five miles away and could not possibly
get help to us. Our task would require nerve and will of
which he knew we had plenty. We were to form two
lines of battle across the gap and were not to fire until he
gave the signal, (by signs, as commands would not be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
heard in the roar of guns.)</p>

<p>The Yankees having failed to break our line on the
mountain had massed their forces at the gap, determined
to break Cleburne’s line, when the rest would be easy for
them.</p>

<p>They came on seven columns deep to our two. We
watched them advance and seconds seemed hours. We
felt they would be on us before Cleburne ever gave the
signal. Would he never give it? At last when the time
was ripe, he, who knew the art of war so well, gave the
signal to fire, and such deadly work did we perform as was
not surpassed in the whole four years of war. We let
loose on them four pieces of cannon. The command to
stop firing was not given until the number of dead in our
front was greater than our Brigade. This fight showed
strategy and bravery. It checked the advance of an army
five times greater than our Division, and it proved to General
Hardee that he had one man who could plan and execute
a battle with any adversary. Ever after, Cleburne
with his Arkansas, Tennessee and Texas men was placed
in the hottest part of battle. Our loss was 88 killed, 23
wounded, and their loss was reported in Northern papers
as 2,000 killed, wounded and captured.</p>

<p>We went into winter quarters at Dalton, our regiment
being in front of the general army. We camped near
Tunnel Hill. We had good foraging ground and could get
chickens, eggs, butter, so we lived high. John Loftin was
captain of the foragers and he was a good one too. He
only got caught once but he lied out of that. Two negroes,
who belonged to two doctors of our Brigade, went
to Dalton one night to see the sights and buy half-moon
pies, big sorghum ginger-bread, and other things. Coming
home at midnight they were crossing a railroad trestle
when two robbers called on them to halt. Sam began
to parley with them when whack! they hit him over the
head, and told him to give up his money. He yielded up
his shin-plasters, all he had. They then took Tom’s can.
He did not have much so they told him to pull. He was a
good runner especially when scared, and he lit out over
rocks and brush, beating his partner to camp. With eyes
as big as saucers he related his exploits to his master.
They did not visit Dalton at night again. We used to go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
over there to see the girls and have parties and sorghum
“candy pulls.” It was a great diversion, and between the
lines, when the guards were on to it they would arrest,
but the boys could usually outgeneral them.</p>

<p>From this camp I was sent on a three days’ furlough
to Augusta to buy some drug supplies not to be found in
Atlanta. When I reached Atlanta whom should I meet
but George Roberts, one of my old mess-mates who had
been transferred to Morgan’s Cavalry. Morgan had been
captured, and all that was left of the command was at Macon
re-organizing. George was buying horses. He was
flush and wanted me to take a thousand dollars, but I had
lots of money, at least for these days. He went to the depot
to see me off. Robert was a fine fellow. He was a
regular city rat. We country boys used to get him to
pilot us around the city. He would know all the streets
in a day and could take us anywhere we wanted to go.
After the war he settled in Texas, where he was cashier
of a bank. He died several years ago.</p>

<p>In Augusta I met Colonel Snyder of the Eighth
Arkansas. He was from Pocahontas, Ark., and was
then on a furlough. I also met Ed M. Dickinson, Thad
Kinman and Ben Adler. They belonged to the quartermaster’s
department under Captain Bridewell and Major
Moon. They kept books as big as a dining table.
As they belonged to this particular department they
helped me to draw a new jacket suit. They lived in a
fine city and fared sumptuously, so knowing all the
ropes they made it mighty pleasant for me. Through
Ed I met an uncle whom I had not seen before. It was
on a crowded street in the city, but I knew him at once
from his resemblance to my father. When I accosted
him he was very dignified and seemed to doubt me until
I told him the names of the whole family. Then he
insisted upon me going to his home. He had an interesting
family. My grandmother died at his home and
was buried in a cemetery in Augusta. I got back to
camp on time. After living off the fat of the land our
regular diet of blue beef and corn bread somehow failed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
to tickle the palate. George Thomas, who had been
wounded at Murfreesboro, got back to us at this camp.</p>

<p>We were waiting to move on the checkerboard.
Jeff Davis, General Bragg, Johnston and all were calling
for the troops to have a decisive battle hereabouts,
but there was a difference of opinion between Davis
and the commanding generals. Our Brigade was ordered,
I suppose to Mississippi. We went by rail to Montgomery,
were halted there, and were sent back to Dalton
and went into camp again.</p>

<p>May 8th, 1864 we began the famous Dalton campaign,
under the leadership of the superb General Joseph
E. Johnston. He had between forty and fifty
thousand men divided into three corps, commanded respectively
by Generals Hardee, Hood and Polk. He was
opposed by Sherman with about 100,000 well drilled seasoned
soldiers [ &hellip; ] by Generals Thomas, McPherson and
Schofield, but Johnston was equal to the campaign.</p>

<p>May 8th we were menaced by the enemy in front and
flank. May 9th we moved our position two miles to the
left and on May 10th we moved rapidly back to the top of
the mountain. We had no tents nor protection of any
kind. We slept on the ground among the rocks. Although
it rained in torrents, we were so dead tired from
our 33 mile march, we did not know it was raining until
we were wet through. At daybreak we were again on the
march and went to Snake Creek Gap, then three miles to
the left and built breastworks. From there we marched
to Resaca. May 15th we had heavy fighting and were
forced from our position. The retreat was covered by
Hardee’s corps. Our engineers had to build, under fire, a
bridge for the army to cross the Costenaula. In fact from
Dalton to Atlanta we had a continuous battle. We moved
back slowly, and only when flanked and outnumbered.
When we adopted a new line a few miles back, we built
breastworks. Thus marching, battling, building works,
in rain and mud, with no camp, no tents and but little
food, the campaign went on. But in all our skirmishes
and engagements we used every advantage to their great
loss. We fell back to Calhoun, then to Adairsville. We
were the rear guard on that road. After we had crossed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
a creek and marched to the top of the hill, (our Cavalry
to the rear), the Yankees moved opposite and opened up a
battery. We were ordered to lie down and not to fire until
told to do so. General Polk and General Jackson rode
in front of us and the sharp-shooters and artillery of the
enemy made it hot for them, bullets going through their
hats and clothes. General Jackson would dodge, but General
Polk would sit as straight as an arrow and never
move a muscle. I heard him when he told General Cleburne
and asked permission to advance on the enemy.
When the courier returned General Cleburne himself
came to see the fun. From our hill could be seen fifty
thousand Yankee troops—Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery.
For our Brigade to advance against such a force was a
visionary idea, and the permission was not given.</p>

<p>We moved on to join our main army which was a few
miles in front drawn up in line of battle near Cassville.
Our line was in open field, five miles long. Each man had
forty cartridges and knew how to use them. General
Johnston rode along the line and told the men he was going
to give battle. The soldiers threw their caps into the
air and shouted themselves hoarse with joy at the
thought of going into a fight which they felt in their
souls would be successful. It was inspiring to see such
enthusiasm in battle scarred veterans who knew what
fighting meant. It was not theory with them, it was
knowledge gained in bloody experience. I was glad I was
on that field and saw that flashing of Southern bravery.
Such patriots are born only of liberty-loving people, born
of God. That confidence of success, that confidence in
their leader was what Joseph E. Johnston had looked for,
had prayed for. He knew his position to be the best he
had ever had. He now knew the temper of his men. Nothing
could have checked them. It would be the biggest
battle of the war and his success.</p>

<p>When this great battle was formed in Johnston’s
brain and the Generals ordered to occupy the ground assigned
them, who was the first to say he could not hold
his position? Who, but General Hood! Histories love to
state that these generals led their men, but here was a
time when the general did not lead into battle the bravest
men in the world who were clamoring for the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>General Polk also expressed his disapproval of the
movement. When his two generals went back on him,
Johnston was paralyzed and could not or did not attempt
to carry out his plan. Unlike Albert Sydney Johnson at
Shiloh, who, when his plan was disapproved of, and obstacles
thrown in his way, arose like the giant hero he
was and said “You who are true, go to your commands.
The battle will begin at daybreak.” If he had lived a few
hours longer he would have won that battle beyond a
doubt.</p>

<p>If Joseph E. Johnston had said something like this
the men would have done the rest, but when he ordered
the line under the skirmish fire to retreat they obeyed
like true soldiers. It was a bitter disappointment, but
their trust in the great commander was firm. He hoped
that other opportunities would offer but when the
time came he was relieved and the command given to that
General who had thwarted the greatest battle of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Johnston’s plan of campaign was the only one possible
for us, fighting against such odds. I am not a general,
nor the son of a general, but having been right on the
ground for four years, feel that I am entitled to an opinion.
And so with all the men who composed Company G,
First Arkansas Regiment, Hardee Corps, Govan Brigade,
Cleburne Division. The verdict of these men who helped
make history is that if Johnston’s [ &hellip; ] had prevailed
the Confederacy would have had a different tale to tell at
Atlanta.</p>

<p>Tacticians now agree that Johnston’s success in preserving
his army almost entire was an achievement of the
greatest military science.</p>

<p>May 19th we left Cassville. We marched mostly by
night, built breastworks, and by daybreak were ready for
the contest. On May 26th the heaviest assault on our
works took place. On our skirmish line, a short distance
in front of our works we had dump holes dug in the
ground, the dirt thrown out facing the enemy. Thirty
men stayed in the dumps until the main line came up.
Then they opened fire and checked the advance. When
they could no longer do this, they ran back to the line behind
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
the breastworks.</p>

<p>At New Hope Church the enemy made a seven line
concentrated assault on our line. Our men were cool and
steady, and all were splendid shots. We waited until they
were very near, then sent forth a sheet of fire and lead
that could not be withstood. The number of their dead
was enormous, and our own loss was considerable. We
lost our first lieutenant, Alley Walthall, here. He was a
distant relative of General Walthall, and as brave a man
as ever lived on earth.</p>

<p>A lieutenant of another company was killed also. He
was in one of the dumps with one of the sixteen rifles.
He had seen four Yankees fall under his well-directed fire,
but at last was mortally wounded. He backed out of the
dump and into a hollow where the enemy could see him
fall. His comrades went out and brought him behind the
breastworks. As he lay on the ground he conversed with
his friends urging them to become Christians. Sending
for the Colonel, he told him that he (the colonel) was a
wicked man, and must lead a better life. By way of comfort
one of the boys told him how many Yankees he had
killed in the assault. The lieutenant said, “Yes, I killed
three. But, my brother, don’t gloat over it. Do your
duty, but don’t gloat over it.” After sending many loving
messages home he passed away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sherman was receiving re-inforcements,
and on June 9th moved against our intrenchments along
Lost Mountains. In this region there was fighting for
several days in the midst of almost incessant rain. General
Polk was killed during this engagement. June 15–17
we abandoned both mountains and fell back to the great
Kennesaw overlooking Marietta.</p>

<p>June 20th two of us got a permit to go to Marietta for
tobacco and other supplies. As we were passing through
the residence part of the city a kind-hearted lady invited
us into the house to eat raspberries with her family. We
did not have the heart to refuse her hospitality, so we
went in. We had raspberries, cream and cake. Think of
it, rebel soldiers regaled with such delicacies! When we
got back to camp we told the boys about it and they said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>
we lied! But the memory of that kind act to strangers
and common privates will last as long as life itself.</p>

<p>On the 27th after a furious cannonading for hours by
the enemy he made a general advance in heavy columns.
Their assault in seven lines deep was vigorous and persistent
on Cheatham’s and Cleburne’s Divisions of Hardee’s
Corps, the Confederates being covered by strong
rifle pits which could not be carried by front attack, coolly
and rapidly pouring a murderous fire into the massed
Federals, causing losses entirely out of proportion to
those inflicted upon the Confederates. The loss of the
enemy in front of Cleburne’s Division was one thousand
deaths. After the repulse of the second desperate assault
the dry leaves and undergrowth in the forest before
Cleburne’s Division were set on fire by the shells and
gun wadding, and began burning rapidly around the Federal
wounded and dead, exposing them to a horrible
death. This danger was observed by the Confederates
who were ordered instantly to cease firing and Lieutenant
Colonel Martin, First Arkansas Regiment of Cleburne’s
Division, called to the Federals that as an act of humanity
his men would suspend further battle until the assailants
could carry off their dead and wounded who were
liable to be burned alive. This offer was accepted by the
Federals and in this work of mercy the Federals were
joined by the Confederates who leaped their head logs
and helped to carry off their dead and wounded. This occurrence
is perhaps unparalleled in the annals of war.
In this great struggle the Federal army numbered about
or over one hundred thousand and Confederates numbered
fifty thousand and in this Kennesaw battle our loss was
eight hundred and eight the Federal loss about five thousand.</p>

<p>July 4th was celebrated by skirmishing all day. Sherman
hoped to catch us and administer a fatal blow before
we could cross the Chattahootchee, but we threw up
strong intrenchments so quickly, and guarded the rear so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
skillfully that the army was all across the river July 5th
without having been molested.</p>

<p>But speaking of the Fourth of July. At this time
Colonel Fellows, who had been with our command on our
first trip to Richmond, was in prison at Johnson’s Island
together with about three thousand other officers. The
rebels gained permission for Colonel Fellows to speak on
the stand used by the guards as a watch tower. As he
poured forth his thoughts, turning the Fourth of July to
the glory of the South even the Yankee guards, who had
stopped to listen were spellbound by his eloquence. He
had it all his own way and the rebels were shouting like
mad. The officer of the day finally awoke to the situation,
took a file of soldiers, and brought the speech to a
close. At another time in the same prison Lincoln’s Proclamation
was read, offering pardon and freedom to all
rebel prisoners who would take the oath of allegiance.
The officers lined up in the barracks and announced that
any man who wished to take the oath might step over to
this line, give his name and be free. When Colonel Fellows
was called he made a five minute talk in which he
declared death was preferable. One of our boys, Shannon
Logan of Co. G, First Arkansas Regiment, eighteen years
old, was captured. He was a relative of General Logan
and when his name appeared General Logan’s family
drove down to the prison with the papers necessary for
his release. They asked to see him and were shown a
dirty, greasy, lousy private. Through the grime they
recognized a fine boy with a noble face. They took him
home, bathed him, clothed him, fed him, then told him
to be their boy thenceforth. If this lonely boy, away
from home, away from comrades had taken the oath he
would have been free, with loving kinsmen, with luxury
and riches, but he said “No, no! I will die first.” So for
him it was back to the filthy prison among the vermin
and the rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
This, one of the many instances of the loyalty displayed
by the rank and file, should be told to coming generations
that they may know how the Southern private
never faltered, but was true to the core.</p>

<p>July 12th we crossed the Chattahootchee near Atlanta.
July 18th we marched four miles and built breastworks.
July 20th there was hard fighting at Peach Tree
Creek in which we lost heavily. Our noble Captain Shoup
was wounded and the command devolved upon Second
Lieutenant Clay Lowe. He and John R. Loftin were the
only commissioned officers we had left.</p>

<p>July 22 we marched ten miles to the right of Atlanta.
Hardee had attacked the enemy in the rear and there had
been a terrible struggle which lasted for hours. Toward
evening we heard the Yankee Bands playing and the soldiers
shooting and cheering and we knew they had won.</p>

<p>While Johnston was in command he had preserved his
army, and inflicted upon the enemy a loss almost
equal to our strength when we began the campaign. Our
loss had been about nine thousand, which had been filled
by the return of the wounded and furloughed men, so that
General Hood received an army fully as strong as it was at
Dalton. We were as ready to fight as ever although certainly
disappointed at the loss of Johnston. We felt that
no other general could do what he had done.</p>

<p>Soon after the war ended Johnston was going from
Memphis to St. Louis. General Sherman and his staff
were on their way to New Orleans. When Sherman learned
that his former adversary was on board a certain boat
he took passage for St. Louis on the same vessel. After
supper he asked Johnston if he had any objection to going
over with him the retreat from Dalton. Johnston said
he had not. So Sherman spread his maps on the cabin
table and, surrounded by a throng of listeners, they began.
Sherman would ask about his line at a certain place,
and Johnston would explain how his move was made.
Sherman would point to his map and say: “How in the
world did you get away from me here?” They talked all
night. Johnston needed no map. He had been in the very
thick of battle for seventy-four days; the map of campaign
was burned into his brain, and he knew every foot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
of the ground. His retreat was a wonder to Sherman and
to the world. Yet this great military genius was thrown
out on the eve of his final and greatest assault upon Sherman.
An assault which would have saved Atlanta to the
Confederacy. Hood and Davis tactics prevailed after that
and the splendid, unconquered army was swept off the
earth into the grave.</p>

<p>Hood questioned the morale of his army, but as for
that, our poor little Company G went into line under Hood
as true as it ever had under Johnston. We fought for the
cause, not the general. Jim Hensley, a boy who had been
wounded severely, returned to the company. His physician
had not reported him for duty, but had given him
merely a pass to his command. I was in the field hospital
when the order to forward was given. Hensley came to
me saying: “Here, my dear old friend, is a little silver
watch I wish to give you, for I shall be killed today.”</p>

<p>I told him he had not been reported for duty; that he
was still far from well, and begged him not to go into battle,
especially as he had a presentiment that he should be
killed. He turned his soulful eyes upon me. “Will, do you
think I am afraid because I know I am going to be killed?”
Putting his hand on his breast he continued, “I
have no fear of death. I am a Christian, and I know I
shall be safe in heaven.” With tears we parted. He joined
his brave comrades, Jim Murphy, John Baird and
George Thomas on the left of Company G, after the line
was in motion. They were moving against strong entrenchments
heavily defended by abatis. These four boys
saw they could crawl under the abatis without being seen
and get close to the breastworks. After they started, the
command was given to oblique to the left, but in the roar
of the musketry the boys failed to hear it and went on
alone. There were about a hundred Yankees on the breastworks
watching our line which was advancing upon their
rear. The four boys crawled close in, prepared, and opened
up. At the first fire down came four Yankees. They
were taken by surprise, not knowing there were any men
at their front. The boys kept at their game until the
Yankees ran. Then went forward to take possession of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
the works. Then they found themselves alone and two
hundred of the enemy entrenched behind a second line!
It was death anyway, so they ran forward firing on the
troops with terrible accuracy. One man had a bead on
Thomas when Murphy shot the fellow. One hinged for
Murphy when Thomas bayoneted him. So they had it—hand
to hand. Poor Hensley was killed, Murphy terribly
wounded, Baird wounded, but Thomas would not surrender.
He bayoneted them until they took his gun, then he
kicked and bit until they finally killed him there. Four
men had killed twenty-five Yankees, but only one of the
four lived to tell the tale. To question the morale of such
men is farcical. The battle on our left raged all day, and
we were defeated. Our colonel lost his foot. One third of
our regiment was gone. Great numbers were killed and
wounded but the troops were as loyal and fought as bravely
as any army on earth. This was Hood’s second defeat.
In two battles, he had lost ten thousand men—more
than we had lost in the whole campaign, in seventy-four
days’ battles and skirmishes. It would not take long with
such tactics to wipe out the rebel army.</p>

<p>July 29th we marched back to Atlanta. August 31st
we marched to Jonesboro and on September 1st we moved
to the right, threw up temporary works and Hardee’s
corps fought the Battle of Jonesboro. Hood’s and Stewart’s
corps were at Atlanta, twenty miles away, and we
were entirely unsupported. We fought all day against
seven corps of Yankees. We were surrounded and fought
in front and in the rear. Fought as General Cleburne always
fought. The Yankees charged our company seven
lines deep, but our thin line held firm until some of the
boys happened to discover a line of Infantry charging in
the rear. Then they began to waver. Our Lieutenant
Commander Clay jumped on top of the breastworks, waved
his gun, (the sixteen-shooter which the officers of our
company carried instead of sabres,) and called to his
men to stand their ground. He was on the breastworks
but a few minutes when he fell, pierced through by
one of the thousand bullets fired at him. As he fell he
saw for the first time why his men wavered. He ordered
a hasty retreat to the right, and although dreadfully
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
wounded successfully threw the line of battle to the rear.
He fell in my arms and I got him to an ambulance and
sent him to a hospital. In Macon we had only one commissioned
officer left, John R. Loftin.</p>

<p>We would have been eaten up entirely, but for the
coming of night, which gave Hardee a chance to unite his
corps and throw up intrenchments. He displayed fine
generalship throughout this engagement. Hardee had
been offered the command of the army in Tennessee before
Hood took it but had replied: “General Johnston is
the only man able to command this army, and I will not
have it.” Here was another terrible defeat for the new
leader. Our loss at Jonesboro was about 2,500 men. The
Yanks put our captured men on the train and sent them
back over the old route. The fort at Dalton was garrisoned
by negro troops. A great number of these negroes
were at the station when the prisoners arrived. They insulted
our men, and tried to take them from the train,
yelling, “No quarter, if we get you on the field.” If white
troops had not come to protect them there would have
been serious trouble.</p>

<p>Our corps camped on the Macon road. It was a dark
night and was raining heavily. By the flashes of lightning
we saw the train of army ambulances coming out of Atlanta,
and we heard female voices singing Dixie and other
Southern songs. These were brave women, non-combatants,
driven from their homes by the infamous order of
Sherman. They had no shelter, no provision and only the
clothes they wore. Some bore nursing babes and one woman
gave birth to a Dixie boy in the wagon train. Yet
these glorious women would not show anguish or cry out
to please the demon general. They shouted for Dixie and
sang on their dreary ride. They went further South out
of range of the beast of a general. He burned Atlanta
and made war on women and children for the rest of the
way on his infamous “march to the sea.” As long as he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
had Johnston to fight he had no time for his diabolical
deeds.</p>

<p>September 12th we marched to Palmetto and camped
there, and President Davis came to review his thrice defeated
army. Beforehand a general order was read, that
no cheers should be given on this review. Never-the-less,
when Davis reached the center of the troops every man on
the field joined in one mighty volume of sound, “Hurrah
for General Johnston.” They knew it would be impossible
to court martial the entire army.</p>

<p>October 1st we crossed the Chattahoochee river at
Moore Bridge. October 9th we crossed the Talacatacline
river and went up the railroad as far as Dalton held by the
negroes who had promised “no quarter” to our boys. General
Cheatham detailed our brigade to guard the wagon
train through a different route about four miles from Dalton,
while he took Granberry’s Brigade and our Texas
troops to attack the fort. As we fought side by side in so
many hard battles the Texas men asked that the Arkansas
regiment (not on the ground) should have the honor
of charging the fort, and this General Cheatham promised.
He surrounded the fort and demanded its surrender.
This was refused. While the artillery made ready
the Texans passed the word down the line as though it
came from General Cheatham, “Kill every damn one of
them,” which would have been carrying out their own
threat of “no quarter.” However, they saved their necks
by five minutes, for when the white officers saw they were
overwhelmingly surrounded they gave up. The prisoners
were put to work at tearing up the railroad track. One of
the negroes protested against the work as he was a sergeant.
When he had paid the penalty for disobeying orders
the rest tore up the road readily and rapidly. That
evening the Texas command moved over to us. We heard
them yelling and singing but we did not know what had
happened. They were guarding the negro prisoners, and
were calling to us, “Here are your ‘no quarter’ negroes,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
come and kill them!” The poor negroes, with eyes popped
out nearly two inches, begged, prayed, and made all sorts
of promises for the future. They soon moved on out of
sight and the general turned them over to the engineering
corps, where they did splendid service. This was better
than killing them.</p>

<p>That day as the wagons were in skirmish line ready
for attack we heard firing in front of our advance column.
Everything stopped and we made ready for action. Advancing,
we discovered the cause of the tumult. A squad
of scouts, whose captain was a man with long red hair,
had given a great deal of trouble to the Yankees in
that vicinity. Because he was an Independent Scout he
had been outlawed and a price was placed upon his head.
He and his outlaws were desperate fellows and accepted
“no quarter” clause. This squad was on our road and as
it happened, met a squad of twenty-two Yankee scouts
coming down the same road. The red-headed captain and
his five men charged the superior squad, wounded six and
killed four. The rest of the Yankees fled in haste. We
were close upon them, so Red Head could not kill the
wounded. He and his men took to the mountains and we
never saw them again.</p>

<p>We passed through Cedar Town and Cave Spring, and
camped on Coosa river. We passed through Center and
camped on Terrapin Creek. We crossed Chuckluck mountains
and camped at Jacksonville. We crossed Coosa at
Gordon and camped on Sand mountain. We camped on
Black Morgan river.</p>

<p>On October 27th we marched seven miles and camped
in line around Decatur. It was a rainy night, so dark we
could not see our file leader. If there were any roads we
could not see them. It was impossible to finish the line of
battle. The army had lost its way. I was standing beside
the other boys holding to a small sapling when a new line
came up, moving as best they could in a hog path, each
man guessing at the way and calling to the man in front.
A log about knee high lay across the path and I saw three
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
different soldiers strike that log and fall over it into the
muddy slash. Each time the man’s gun went splashing
ahead striking the fellow in front. There was cussin’ all
along the line. Finally we ran out on the log and warned
others who came along, turning them safely around that
point. On October 28th we went further in, completed
the line and fought the Battle of Decatur. The night after
the battle it turned so cold we nearly froze to death,
but we did not mind marching over frozen ground.</p>

<p>October 30th we marched thirty miles and passed
Courtland, Alabama. On the 31st we marched twelve
miles and camped at Tuscumbia. November 13th we
crossed the Tennessee on a pontoon bridge at Florence.
November 14th we built breastworks. On the 22nd we
marched thirty-two miles and crossed the state line into
Tennessee. On the 23rd we passed Warrenton, the 25th
through Henryville, and the 26th through Mount Pleasant.
We camped on General Pillow’s place. He had a
grand old Southern home. A fine brick mansion, surrounded
by beautiful groves with splendid driveways. He
had his own church, a comfortable and pretty brick building.
These cultured people of the best blood of the South
lived in this ideal spot and educated their children by
teachers who lived in the home. Two members of this
family, Ed Pillow and J. D. Pillow, live in Helena, where
they still keep up the family customs and traditions.</p>

<p>November 27th we marched nineteen miles and
camped near Columbia. The enemy under Schofield had
retreated from Mount Pleasant to Columbia and had entrenched
in a formidable position. We went around them
and crossing the Duck river on pontoon and rail bridges,
we double-quicked to Spring Hill and engaged the enemy
with Cleburne’s Division. Our regiment was one of the
first in action, after the cavalry had skirmished with them.
Night overtook us and we could not see to fight. Forrest
wished to attack them, even in the night, but was not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
permitted. As their force was much superior to ours, it
would have been useless. Hood did not think they would
retreat, but at daylight, when he began to complete his
line, surrounding them, he discovered that they had flown
to Franklin! With muffled cannon, silently and swiftly,
Schofield had fled through the night.</p>

<p>Company G lost some good men at Spring Hill. We
established a hospital there, with Dr. Brickie and Dr.
Gray in charge to care for the wounded. We brought the
ordnance from Columbia and followed the enemy.</p>

<p>The Yankees had been reinforced and had entrenched
at Franklin, behind the works they had built some months
before. In front of their works was an open field with not
a tree or ravine for a mile and a half. Just before the
breastworks was an open ditch six feet wide and three
feet deep. At the end of the ditch next to the breastworks,
were placed poles sharpened spear-shape. Their
main works were six feet at the base. The cannon-breast
portion was cut down so that the guns, resting on oak
logs, were on a level with our bodies. Behind the whole
was a thicket of locust trees, as close together as they
could possibly grow. After the battle these trees were
found to have been cut off level with the breastworks by
Confederate balls.</p>

<p>As a description of this battle of Franklin, November
30, 1864, I insert an extract from the Park Marshall address
delivered forty-eight years afterward:</p>

<p>“I was born at Franklin, and as a small boy I visited
this battle field when the smoke had scarcely disappeared,
and the impression of that morning is still in my memory.
Without exaggeration I may say that the severest battle
of modern history was fought on these plains. In the
forefront of that battle there were not over 20,000 Union
troops, not over 15,000 Confederates, yet the killed on one
side was greater in two or three hours than occurred on
any one day on one side in any other battle of the Civil
War, except Antietam.</p>

<hr class="page" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>“All
the generals objected to the charge. Forrest,
the best cavalry leader in the South, begged Hood to
change his murderous plan, saying, ‘I know every hog-path
in this county, and I can show you a route which will
give us a chance.’</p>

<p>“The lesser generals entered their protest along with
the great generals. Men of world-wide fame, and privates
too, had their opinion, but not the right to speak.</p>

<p>“To send soldiers against such a position was suicidal.
Every man in the South available for service was in
the field. When these men were killed the Confederacy
was destroyed. Oh, for a Johnston before the fatal word
was given! Against every protest Hood ordered the advance.
What were Cleburne’s last words to his noble warrior
boys?</p>

<p>“Boys, we are ordered to charge the works. I don’t
think we can take them, but we can try. Forward!”</p>

<p>“In thirty minutes this glorious patriot’s blood was
flowing upon the ground. The advance was made without
a halt, but men were mowed down as wheat before the
reaper. They marched to the breastworks and scaled the
walls, but they were bayoneted on top of the works and
fell over on the enemy. Seven dead generals were brought
and laid on this porch—Cleburne, Granberry, Strahl, Gist,
Carter and Adams. Adams fell, leaving his dead horse on
the very crest of the breastworks. Cleburne’s horse fell
also crossing the works. This is one of the most heroic
pictures of the war.”</p>

<p>Sixty per cent of our army was killed and wounded.
The enemy retreated to Nashville after the best day’s
work (for them) they had ever done.</p>

<p>Our company had but one officer left. We were consolidated
with Company B and the two together scarcely
made a full company. The whole regiment was consolidated
into six companies, instead of ten.</p>

<p>The enemy’s loss was slight compared with ours. The
bravest of the blood of the South was poured out for nothing.
Who was right, Johnston or Hood?</p>

<p>We followed Schofield to Nashville and invested that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
post, but we were outnumbered, as he had been re-inforced
from every quarter. He broke our line and captured
about half of our regiment. My friend, Bob Bond was
captured; Logan too, and many others.</p>

<p>We retreated in quick time. Near Spring Hill a squad
of about fifty cavalrymen made a dash through our line,
as we had stacked arms and were preparing to camp for
the night, and went far to the rear. Coming along the
pike, never dreaming of danger, were four soldiers, bearing
a wounded man on a litter. The Yankee squad shot
the doctor’s horse, wounding the doctor and killed one of
the four soldiers. As the poor fellow fell, the wounded
man rolled out on the pike. The front line, recovered from
its surprise, grabbed the guns, surrounded the Yankees,
captured them and made things lively for them for awhile.</p>

<p>We crossed the river at Columbia on two pontoon
bridges, one for Forrest’s cavalry, being about two hundred
yards below us, down the river. It was almost dark,
but skirmishing was still going on, when Forrest’s pontoon
broke loose, leaving him, his staff and about two hundred
of his cavalry.</p>

<p>Our ordnance was crossing on our bridge, and all was
over except two wagons. Our regiment was waiting on
the bank. General Cheatham and his staff were at the
top of the bank. General Forrest rode up to our bridge
and was about to cut off the three wagons of ordnance
when the driver whipped up his horses to join the other
wagons. Forrest took his pistol and threatened to kill
him if he attempted to go on the bridge ahead of the cavalry.
The driver was quite plucky. He said his orders
were to follow the ordnance train; if General Forrest did
not like it he must go to higher officers. Forrest was furious.
He spurred his horse and went to General Cheatham,
swearing he would cross that bridge ahead of the ordnance.
General Cheatham was perfectly calm, and explained
that he wished to get the wagons over before
night, and into camp, so he could lay his hands on his ordnance.
Forrest was not pacified. He drew his pistol and
threatened to shoot Cheatham, who rode to him at once,
saying, “Shoot; I am not afraid of any man in the Confederacy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
The infantry with loaded guns, closed in around
them, prepared to defend Cheatham. The cavalrymen,
who had not heard what was said, came up the hill to see
what was going on. Forrest’s adjutant plunged between
the two generals and pulled Forrest down toward the
bridge. By that time the wagons were over. So General
Forrest and his troops crossed the bridge without further
parley. It might have been a terrible tragedy. If either
general had been killed, we would have had war right
there.</p>



<p>Next day Forrest sent an apology to Cheatham, at
least so it was reported. The affair was witnessed by our
company, but it was kept quiet as we had troubles enough
without fighting each other. Forrest was a great officer
and a fine cavalry leader, but he was tyrannical and hot-headed.</p>

<p>December 20th we marched all day on the pike to Pulaski
in a cold rain—a rain that froze on the trees. We had
to sleep on the wet ground. Many men were barefooted
and marched over the pike with bleeding feet. We were
called the “straggling squad” because we had to march
more slowly than the others, and we were between the infantry
and the rear cavalry, commanded by Forrest. In
his mind a straggler deserved death. When he came up to
a poor little squad he struck one, a Lieutenant, who was
in charge of the barefoot squad, over the head with his
sword and ordered him to go on and keep up with his command.
He would listen to no excuse, as if these barefooted
men, braving sleet and snow with bleeding feet, were
not doing their duty as loyally as any man in the army.</p>

<p>These incidents are a part of the unwritten history;
merely a few things that I know to be facts in our army
life with Company G.</p>

<p>We established a hospital at Pulaski to care for our
sick and wounded, and left it in charge of Dr. Brickie. I
went to the Colonel of our regiment and told him I feared
Dr. Brickie would detail me to be his druggist; that I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
wanted a pass so I could go on ahead and meet the command
beyond the town. He gave it to me and I had gotten
about half a mile beyond Pulaski, when I heard a horse
galloping behind me. It was the Division Surgeon, Dr. L.,
who stopped me, saying, “Are you Bill Bevens of Company
G, First Arkansas.”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“I detailed you to report to Dr. Brickie, corps surgeon
in charge of Corps Hospital at Pulaski.”</p>

<p>“I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, I will have you court-martialed.”</p>

<p>“All right, but I won’t go.”</p>

<p>After he rode away I thought more soberly. I had
been in the army four years and had never been arrested.
Perhaps I had better go. I went back, but I gave it to Dr.
Brickie. I told him there were a hundred druggists in
that army; why didn’t he get some other one? He answered
that he had selected me because he knew I would
not drink his whiskey nor give it away to “bums,” but
keep it for the sick. I told him I would give away every
spoonful of it. I told him it was all right for him to be
captured. He would be paroled. But I should be sent to
Johnson’s Island to freeze.</p>

<p>He said he would arrange that. He knew all the assistant
surgeons and told them when we were captured
they must address me as “Doctor.” He ordered Dr. Gray
to take charge of Ward 4, but to call it my ward.</p>

<p>So the army went without me and I felt sad indeed. I
had not been separated from my comrades before. But
“It is not what you want that makes you fat, but what
you have.”</p>

<p>Forrest’s cavalry was the last to leave. High officers
would call on Dr. Brickie, cough and say they were ill,
hoping he would give them a drink. He was a positive
man and all men looked alike to him. The reply was always,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
“Not a darned drop; it is for the sick and wounded.”
The cavalry surgeons would beg for some, but to no
purpose, for they got the same answer.</p>

<p>The infantry had been gone four days. Some of our
patients had been taken to the homes of the good Southern
women, some had gone with the cavalry, on horseback
and in wagons. There was a big decrease in our hospital.
About three o’clock in the afternoon Dr. Brickie told me I
could go and gave me a pass. He added, “Here are ten
plugs of tobacco; you can hire some of the cavalry fellows
to let you ride, and you may keep up with them.”</p>

<p>I left him with a glad heart, but I did not know what
I was up against. A lone web-foot to keep up with Forrest’s
Cavalry! I was certainly used to hardships, but
that was more than I could do, to save my life. I went
over the muddy road until my wind was almost gone, and
I had to rest. One of our boys belonging to Hardee’s
Guards, came along and spying me, rode up to where I
was saying, “Bill, is that you? You have too much baggage.
Give me some of it, and I will deliver it to your
regiment wagons when I get back to the army.”</p>

<p>I unloaded, rested for an hour and struck out again.
The cavalry was ahead of me. I moved faster, for a Yankee
rear does sometimes hurry a fellow.</p>

<p>I went all night; slept in the road and at daylight
started again, making a good day’s march. Late in the
evening I found I was near the cavalry again, so I made
great strides to catch up. Ahead I saw a bridge across a
stream and Forrest and his staff walking on the gravel
bar. I hoped I could slip over before they saw me and
handed the guard my pass. He said, “You will have to
show it to General Forrest.” I was frightened sure
enough. General Forrest did not care for passes or anything
else when out of humor. I had faced a thousand
Yankee guns, but I couldn’t face Forrest!</p>

<p>I waited some distance off, hoping he would go to an
other part of the line, but he seemed to attend to that
bridge himself. Finally he did walk away a few paces.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
Then I ran up to the adjutant, showed him my pass, and he
waved the guard to let me go over.</p>

<p>I tried to beat Forrest to the next bridge, but when I
got there he was on the bank higher above it. By their
firelight I could see the infantry across the river and I
thought, “I am safe now.” When I reached the pontoon
bridge over the Tennessee, the cavalry was crossing. I
started across in the dark, but the guard stopped me.
“You can’t cross here—pass or no pass—you will have to
see General Forrest.” I argued with that guard, but it
did no good. Then I thought to myself, “He will not
shoot into his own men,” and I said, “I am going across
and you may shoot me if you like.” I ran past him. He
could not see me in the dark, or he might have shot.</p>

<p>After I got across the bridge I found that my command
had gone two days before, so I camped all night by
the straggler’s fire. It was one of the worst nights of the
campaign. A biting cold wind was blowing and we fairly
froze to the ground. For two days I followed my regiment.
My rations gave out and I was trudging along the
road, forlorn and very hungry, when I heard some one call
me. It was a boy of Company G, detailed with the engineers’
corps. I stayed with him that night. He had
plenty of grub and filled me up.</p>

<p>December 27th, we passed Tuscumbia and on the 29th
we camped at Iuka. On this march we crossed Bear Creek
on a railroad bridge. The mules were unhitched from the
wagons and led across. When I got there a fine pair of
mules were on the bridge. They got half way over, then
mule-like, decided they would back a little, and they backed
clear off the bridge and went under the water, head and
ears, to the amusement of the web-foot soldiers.</p>

<p>January 1, 1865, we marched seven miles and camped
near Corinth. Here we washed up, and felt of ourselves,
to see if we were all there. Here I caught up with my
command. I surely was glad to see the boys and they
were to see me, for they supposed I was eating rats on
Johnson’s Island. There were not many of us left. The
killed, wounded and captured at Nashville had about finished
the “shooting-match.”</p>

<p>We traveled over the Mobile &amp; Ohio railroad to Tupelo,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
from which place I was sent to Aberdeen to bring
the medical wagons to Alesia, where they were to be put
on cars and taken to South Carolina. At Richmond
(while I was in Aberdeen) it was decided to give a furlough
to seven men of every company, so we might visit
our homes in Arkansas. The boys put my name in the
hat and drew for me and I got it. The other boys who
got furloughs left at Meridian to make their way to Arkansas.
They meant to take chances at crossing the river
to get home. I was waiting at the Alesia station to deliver
my medical supplies. The officer who came to ship
them said, “Isn’t your name Bill Bevens?” I said, “Yes.”
“Well, you have a furlough for 120 days to go to Arkansas.”
I said, “You are wrong. I never applied for one.
Never have had one. I have been with the army nearly
four years and have never seen Arkansas in all that time.”</p>

<p>But as the train flew by, the boys yelled at me that I
had a furlough; so I went to see about it. It was at the
Eighth Arkansas headquarters and I had no authority to
stop. I had to go to South Carolina before I could get it.
My crowd went without me.</p>

<p>I went on with the army. At Mobile some of us went
again to the Battle House restaurant. We ate three rations
in one meal, and our bill was one hundred and twenty
dollars. Our paper currency had taken a great fall.</p>

<p>It was a cold ride down on the Mobile &amp; Ohio railroad.
The soldiers were thinly clad and few of them had
shoes. One or two men froze, riding on top of the cars.
We traveled to Milledgeville, Georgia, and from there we
had to march over a forty mile gap to the Augusta road.
I found my friends, Ed Dickinson, Ben Adler and Thad
Kinman were still in Augusta. They got me a new gray
suit with a long tail coat. I sure was dressed in the
height of style, but my shoes hardly corresponded to my
suit. They were not very stylish.</p>

<p>In South Carolina I got my furlough, told my comrades
good-bye, and took letters from them to the home-folks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
General Cheatham was in a box car and I got on the
same car. It was the first time I had seen him since the
quarrel with Forrest. I told him I had a furlough and I
wanted to get transportation. He seemed to doubt it and
said, “Let me see your furlough.” He looked at the signature
and he knew it was genuine.</p>

<p>Securing transportation I went back to Augusta. I
went out to Belair, ten miles from the city, where my uncle
had a summer residence. He was very kind to me.
Next morning we went into the city and found a great
commotion. General Beauregard was placing all stragglers
in the guard house. My uncle said, “Son, you go
back to Belair and I will see General Beauregard about it.”
But I answered, “The general will have you in the guard
house if you go to bothering him. I have an authority
that ranks him or any general, as it is by order of the war
department.”</p>

<p>When we went back to Belair that night my uncle
presented me with a fine pair of boots which cost $100.
Then my stylish outfit was complete. I told them good-bye,
went to see Ed Dickinson, Ben Adler and Thad Kinman,
and left for home.</p>

<p>I got to Forty Mile Gap. I had more baggage than
when I went down. As I marched along one of the drivers
of the four-mule wagons asked if I wanted to ride. A
web-foot never refused. He said he would walk if I
would ride and drive, but I told him I had never driven a
four-mule team in my life.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said he, “the mules follow the
wagon ahead without a driver.”</p>

<p>I rode his mule and drove his wagon, stylishly dressed,
as I have said, in my long-tailed coat and fine new
boots. The Virginia soldiers going on foot to their command,
guyed me greatly. “When the war is over I bet
that fellow will never tell that he drove a wagon train.”
Then others would yell, “Don’t that guy look fine with his
gay clothes on?” General Walthold came along and attracted
by my dress, eyed me muchly. I did not know what
was in my wagon, and to avoid inquiry, and trouble for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
the driver, I began to whip up the mules, looking the other
way. But that didn’t work. The general called out authoritatively,
“What have you, sir, in that wagon?”</p>

<p>“Quartermaster’s supplies,” I answered, hastening
on. Soon I passed the danger line for myself and the
driver and was safe from any general (except a Yankee
General!)</p>

<p>I stayed with the driver until two o’clock in the
morning, when I had to leave for Milledgeville, to be in
time for the outgoing train. I got there ahead of time,
and witnessed one of the sad trials of refugees. An old
man and his daughter, a beautiful young girl, were apparently
in great haste to get their baggage off on the train,
and seemed relieved when they had stowed away the last
package. They themselves were just getting on the train
when two policemen arrested the old man and started
back to town with him. There were eight or ten Arkansas
and Texas soldiers on the train. They could not see a
nice young girl driven off the cars, and her father treated
like a criminal. When she began to cry the crisis had arrived.
They jumped off with their guns and pistols and
took the old man from the policemen, gave him a pistol,
saying, “Kill them both, and we will bury them right
here.” The old man refused to shoot, but the policemen
did not tarry, nor did they come back.</p>

<p>At Montgomery I was joined by Tobe Hicks, who was
going to Helena, Arkansas. As he had come but lately
from the Trans-Mississippi army on some war business,
and knew the route across the river, I decided to stick to
him.</p>

<p>We took a boat to Selma, on the Alabama river.
There were many comrades on board and we passed the
time in talking of the war. From Selma we went to Kingston,
which was twenty-two miles from the railroad. We
had to hurry to meet the train. We left at twelve o’clock
and walked the ties to the junction, doing the twenty-two
miles by seven o’clock. It was hard on Tobe Hicks. To
our dismay we missed the train by five minutes and there
was no other. We slept on the ground that night and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
next morning started on the hundred mile walk to Meridian.</p>

<p>At Meridian we took the Jackson railroad, but had
been on the train only three hours when we came to a
wash-out bridge and had to walk again.</p>

<p>At Panola we gave a negro ten dollars to put us
across the river in a skiff. Everywhere was water, water,
water.</p>

<p>When we could go no further we fell in with four
men going down Cold Water on a flat boat with two bales
of cotton. We told our tale of woe and they agreed to let
us go with them if we would pull the boat. Although we
had always lived on a river, we had never played deck
hands. But this was no time to be dignified. We laid
hold of the oars and played deck hand for two days and a
night. They were hard steamboat men. We could stand
it no longer. Late in the afternoon Tobe said, “Let’s land
here.” We landed and took off our traps. They tried to
bully us into going on, but we were used to bluffs, and
they couldn’t work it.</p>

<p>By walking ridges and wading sloughs, we came to
the Mississippi. It was miles wide. We went to the
house of a man whom Hicks knew. He told us the Yankees
had patrol boats out every night and we would certainly
be captured. We were between the devil and the
deep blue sea. If we went back we would be captured; if
we went on we would be captured. But danger had been
our meat and drink for four years. We decided to build
a raft of cedar logs, huge and square and long and light.
We built it in a slough, back from the river, and when it
was finished, we went to eat supper with this friend and
bid him good-bye. Crossing the Mississippi at night on a
raft could never be the safest journey in the world. With
the Yankee patrol boat ready to capture us the danger
was doubled.</p>

<p>But our friend said he knew of a man who had a skiff
(if the Yankees had not burned it) that he would come
for us if we could make him hear. We called and to our
joy the fellow answered. He landed us at the mouth of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
St. Francis river about one o’clock in the morning, and we
gave him our watches and other valuables in payment for
his services.</p>

<p>We had to wade again, but we hurried on. At last
we came to the parting of the ways, for Hicks was going
to Helena and I to Jacksonport. We felt rather sad at
separating after walking, wading, riding, playing deckhand
and building rafts together.</p>

<p>To guide me Hicks gave me the names of all the men
on the road who were o. k. About two o’clock in the
morning I called up one of these o. k. men and asked to
stay all night. He laughed and said, “It is day now.”</p>

<p>I told him I had been up all night and must walk for
my life that day. I must have two hours’ sleep—on the
floor, anywhere.</p>

<p>He told me the Yankees would capture me, but if
they came I could run out the back door to the wood behind.
He called me at four o’clock for a cup of coffee and
a good breakfast, gave me nice lunch for noon, and I was
walking on the slippery road before daylight. I walked
for my life and made forty miles that day. When ready
to pick out a place for the night I went to a house to find
out where I was. The good woman saw that I was a rebel,
and asked me what was my command.</p>

<p>“Cleburne’s old Division, Govan’s Brigade, Army of
Tennessee,” I answered.</p>

<p>She burst out crying, “For God’s sake go on,” she
said, “Last night they captured my son from the same
command.”</p>

<p>I declared I was not tired at all, and had a half hour
more of daylight anyhow. She told me how to get off the
big road and where to stay all night. I went five miles
further and when I asked for a night’s lodging the good
citizen had to be shown my furlough. Then he was glad
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
to see me, gave me a fine supper and a good bed, and went
with me next morning to show me the short cuts.</p>

<p>That day I went through the prairie, nine miles of
sage grass. All day it poured rain, rain, rain. When
about half way across there came a terrific cloudburst and
I was nearly drowned. I thought, “Oh, to think that, after
my perilous crossing of the great Mississippi, I should
be drowned on a prairie so near home.” I held my blanket
over my head and out in front of me, so that I could
breathe, and that saved me. Before I got to the next
house I poured the water out of my boots and washed my
socks. I pulled off my pants and washed them. I did this
because I was afraid the family would not let such a muddy
straggler stay all night. But they were nice to me.</p>

<p>I resumed my journey at daybreak. Bayou Deview
was out of its banks. I waded to the channel, waist deep.
I do not know how long I was about it, but I finally got
across and saw the sand ridges and the big home road.</p>

<p>I had to cross Cache river at Gray’s Ferry. As a boy
I had known Dr. Gray but he did not know me. I went to
the house, introduced myself, and showed him my furlough.
He asked when I crossed the Mississippi. I told
him. Had I walked all the way? I told him I had. Was
I any relation of Judge Bevens of that district? I told
him Judge Bevens was my uncle. He finished by saying,
“You have walked all the way from St. Francis river and
have not stolen a horse?” I told him I was a gentleman,
not a horse thief. He said, “Certainly, I will put you
across the Cache river.” He called to a negro to bring two
horses, and we rode about a mile to the ferry. There a
man met us with a skiff and took me across. I went on
my way and began to know the landmarks. When I
reached the fork of the roads, (one leading to Augusta;
the other to Jacksonport), I sat down to rest.
Jim Howell, the deputy sheriff rode up. He looked at me
for a minute, then shouted, “Why, is that you, Bill Bevens,
what in hell are you doing here?”</p>

<p>I showed him my furlough and told him about my
journey. He made me ride, while he walked to his house,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
a few miles up the road. Then he put a little negro up behind
me to ride some miles further.</p>

<p>I met Bill Campbell, who lost a leg at Shiloh. He
wanted me to stay and talk, but I was headed for home
and would not stop. I went on to Colonel McCoy’s at Tupelo.
I spent the night with Bruce Waddell. He lost a
leg at Shiloh. It was the first time I had seen him since.
I helped carry him off the field. It was a happy meeting,
and we talked nearly all night. He sent a little negro with
me to Village Creek. I crossed in a canoe and walked the
rest of the way—six miles—to Jacksonport.</p>

<p>Home again! Was it only four years ago that the
Jackson Guards had marched to the Presbyterian church
to receive its banner from loving hands? How many
miles we had traveled. How many battles we had fought.
How many wretched homes and blazing cities we had
seen. The sorrows, wounds, sufferings and deaths of centuries
were crowded into those four years. Oh, the pity
of it!</p>

<p>I went straight to my sister’s home. Her little girls
were dressed in long clothes, “playing lady.” Their mother
was at a neighbor’s and one of them went for her, not
telling her why she was wanted at home. Her surprise
at seeing me was great, and our meeting joyous beyond
words.</p>

<p>She and the children went with me to father’s home
in the next county. My mother had not heard from me,
and she did not know whether I was alive or dead. She
fell on my neck, cried, laughed, shouted. She almost died
of joy. Father was too happy, and too full for utterance.</p>

<p>Mother would look at me for hours and could not talk
for joy. Her dear soul was never happier than now with
her dear soldier boy safe at home, surrounded by loved
ones. God gives no boy a better heritage than such a
sweet Christian home and such love.</p>

<p>With her boy a thousand of miles away, and no mails,
her prayers for him were the only connecting links. The
boy on the field of death remembered his mother’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
prayers and was comforted in every danger.</p>

<p>I was unaccustomed to sleeping in a house, and at
first used to take my blanket to the yard, but mother
could not stand that and I had to go back. My sisters
would look under rocks and planks and in various hiding
places and bring out my jewelry and other treasures
which they had hidden from the Yankees.</p>

<p>Before my furlough was out came the news of General
Lee’s surrender at Appomattox. The long cruel war
was over and I was separated no more from my home and
mother. At Jacksonport I met the boys who had been
furloughed with me, but had reached home first—John R.
Loftin, Forrest Dillard, Haggerton and others. It was
good to be with the old comrades once more. We took up
our work again. I began selling drugs. I married here
and am still in Jackson county, at Newport, Arkansas.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
